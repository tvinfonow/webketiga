McCarthy</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>January 26, 1965</strong> in Bakersfield, California, <strong>United States</strong>. McCarthy was born in Bakersfield, California, the son of Roberta Darlene (née Palladino; November 16, 1940–), a homemaker, and Owen McCarthy (June 12, 1941 – January 28, 2000), an assistant city fire chief. McCarthy is a fourth-generation resident of Kern County. He is the first Republican in his immediate family, as his parents were members of the Democratic Party. He attended California State University, Bakersfield, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in marketing in 1989 and a Master of Business Administration in 1994.</p><p>McCarthy was elected to the California State Assembly in 2002. He became the Republican floor leader in 2003. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2006.</p><p>As a freshman congressman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican steering committee. Republican leader John Boehner appointed him chairman of the Republican platform committee during the committee’s meetings in Minneapolis in August 2008, which produced the Republican Party Platform for 2008. He was also one of the three founding members of the GOP Young Guns Program.</p><p>McCarthy opposed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which added perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disabilities as protected classes under existing federal hate crimes law. He has voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007.</p><p align=justify>He was formerly chairman of the California Young Republicans and the Young Republican National Federation. McCarthy worked as district director for U.S. Representative Bill Thomas, and in 2000 was elected as a trustee to the Kern Community College District.

McCarthy is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kevin A. McCarthy</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Kevin Owen McCarthy (born January 26, 1965) is an American politician serving in the United States House of Representatives. A member of the Republican Party, he is the House Minority Leader, having previously served as House Majority Leader from August 2014 to January 2019. He has been the U.S. Representative for California’s 23rd congressional district since 2007. The 23rd district, numbered as the 22nd district from 2007 to 2013, is based in Bakersfield and includes large sections of Kern County and Tulare County, as well as part of the Quartz Hill neighborhood in northwest Los Angeles County.</p><p align=justify>McCarthy served on the staff of Congressman Bill Thomas from 1987 to 2002. In 1995, he was chairman of the California Young Republicans. From 1999 to 2001, he was chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. From the late 1990s until 2000, he was Thomas’s district director. McCarthy won his first election in 2000, as a Kern Community College District trustee.</p><p align=justify>In 2003, while minority leader in the state assembly, McCarthy “support[ed] most abortion rights, but oppose[d] spending tax dollars on abortions”. By 2015, however, McCarthy was a “staunch anti-abortion-rights advocate.” McCarthy is a supporter of the Hyde Amendment (a provision, annually renewed by Congress since 1976, that bans federal funds for abortion), and in 2011 co-sponsored a bill, the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, to make the Hyde Amendment permanent. This bill was especially controversial because it provided an exemption for funding terminations of pregnancies caused by only “forcible rape”, which prompted abortion-rights activists to call the bill a redefinition of rape. McCarthy opposes a California state law that requires health insurance plans “to treat abortion coverage and maternity coverage neutrally and provide both”, believing that this law violates the Weldon Amendment and other federal laws. McCarthy received a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee, and a 0% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2011, McCarthy was the primary author of the “Wilderness and Roadless Area Release Act” (H.R. 1581), legislation that would strip 60 million acres of public lands of protected status. Under the bill, protections for roadless and wilderness study areas would be eliminated, and vast swaths of land opened to new industrial development (such as logging, mineral extraction, and fossil fuel extraction). The bill was strongly criticized by conservationist groups and by former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, who called it “the most radical, overreaching attempt to dismantle the architecture of our public land laws” that he had seen in his lifetime.</p><p>In August 2011, McCarthy and Cantor led a group of 30 Republican members of Congress to Israel, where some members took part in a late-night swim in the Sea of Galilee, including one member—Representative Kevin Yoder of Kansas—who swam nude. When McCarthy and Cantor later found out about the swim, they “were furious” and worried about negative news coverage, and “called a members-only meeting the next morning to reprimand the group – both those who swam and those who abstained.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin A.

This district was as heavily Republican as its predecessor, and McCarthy won a fourth term with 73.2% of the vote vs. 26.8% for independent, No Party Preference (NPP) opponent, Terry Phillips.</p><h2>Who is Kevin A.
