Heather Foster was born 1966 in Kingston, Jamaica.&nbsp;Foster has one brother and two sisters.&nbsp;When she was two-and-half years old, her parents moved to Jamaica, Queens and New York City.&nbsp;She was an active child from a young age. She didn’t want to be a potholder in Girl Scouts and instead wanted to go outside and play basketball, stick ball and race against the boys.&nbsp;She was always interested in sports, including competitive high school and college track and field and playing high school basketball and junior high school basketball.</p><p>Heather won the heavyweight title and overall in her first professional competition, Women’s Pro Extravaganza 2001.&nbsp;She won the Europa Super Show in 2006, her second professional competition.&nbsp;She did not compete in 2008 and 2009.&nbsp;She placed 6th at the Ms. Olympia in 2010.</p><p>Heather, her sister, and younger brother all started playing in the church basketball league after their father insisted they did.

Her teacher saw a gift in me and decided to sign me up to audition for New York State Voice. They were only accepting 300 students from various New York high schools, and she was selected with a score of 99 out of 100. While in high school, our church choir competed in, and won the 3rd annual McDonald’s Gospelfest, which awarded us the opportunity to perform in two concerts at the famed Apollo Theater, where she performed one and a half leads for both scheduled performances. Due to vocal inactivity, she is not as good as she used to be.</p><p align=justify>Heather eventually agreed to perform the show.&nbsp;Heather was instructed the seven poses and then told to create a routine to music.&nbsp;She was so nervous on competition day that she wore sunglasses to block out the view of everyone and demanded that the house lights be dimmed for the same reason.&nbsp;She finished second in the heavyweight category and did so without having to light a single weight before the competition.&nbsp;At the 2000 NPC Nationals, New York, she turned professional.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Heather Foster</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Heather</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Foster</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bodybuilder</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kingston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Heather Foster ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
