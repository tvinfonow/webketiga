He is widely regarded as one of the greatest fighters in mixed martial arts (MMA) history. St-Pierre was a two-division champion in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), having won titles in the welterweight and middleweight divisions. He is set to be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2020.</p><p>The fight ended after the fourth round when Penn’s cornerman, Jason Parillo, requested that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted that he could not recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because “I was probably borderline knocked out or something.” During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre’s back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp. Dana White said it was unfortunate GSP’s dominant win was overshadowed by the cornerman controversy. “Do I think that he got greased? Yeah, I do,” White told The Canadian Press prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. “Absolutely, 100 per cent, I think that that guy was rubbing grease on him. Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that.”</p><p align=justify>The couple was Roland St-Pierre and Pauline in Saint-Isidore, Quebec.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georges St-Pierre</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georges</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>St-Pierre</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MMA Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saint-Isidore</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Georges St-Pierre ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
