He drew musical influence from his father, Bob Chesnutt, who was a singer and record collector. Chesnutt first played drums as a child after receiving a drum kit as a Christmas gift, but at his father’s persuasion, he stopped playing drums and chose to focus on singing instead. He dropped out of school in the eleventh grade to begin playing in clubs around southeast Texas. When he turned 17, his father began to take him to Nashville, Tennessee, to begin recording. For the next ten years, he began to record on small regional labels while he was the house band for local Beaumont nightclub Cutters. By the late 1980s, he had released eight singles, which would later be released together as an album titled Doing My Country Thing. Record producer Tony Brown heard one of Chesnutt’s independent releases, and recommended him to Mark Wright, a songwriter, session musician, and record producer who helped Chesnutt sign with the Nashville branch of MCA Records in 1990. The same year, Bob Chesnutt died of a heart attack.</p><p>Mark Nelson Chesnutt (born September 6, 1963) is an American country music singer and songwriter. Between 1990 and 1999, he had his greatest chart success recording for Universal Music Group Nashville’s MCA and Decca branches, with a total of eight albums between those two labels. During this timespan, Chesnutt also charted twenty top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, of which eight reached number one: “Brother Jukebox”, “I’ll Think of Something”, “It Sure Is Monday”, “Almost Goodbye”, “I Just Wanted You to Know”, “Gonna Get a Life”, “It’s a Little Too Late”, and a cover of Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”. His first three albums for MCA (Too Cold at Home, Longnecks & Short Stories, and Almost Goodbye) along with a 1996 Greatest Hits package issued on Decca are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); 1994’s What a Way to Live, also issued on Decca, is certified gold. After a self-titled album in 2002 on Columbia Records, Chesnutt has continued to record predominantly on independent labels.</p><p align=justify>He was married to Tracie Chesnutt in 1992.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark Chesnutt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chesnutt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Beaumont</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bob Chesnutt, Norma Jean Chesnutt</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tracie Chesnutt</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Casey Chesnutt, Waylon Chesnutt, Cameron Chesnutt</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark Chesnutt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It accounted for five chart singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. The title track (written by Bobby Harden of The Harden Trio) was released first, achieving a peak of number three on that chart, while reaching number one on the country music charts published by Radio & Records, Gavin Report, and Cashbox. The second single was “Brother Jukebox”, which was written by Paul Craft, originally released as a single by Don Everly of The Everly Brothers in 1977, and also recorded by Keith Whitley on his 1989 album I Wonder Do You Think of Me. Chesnutt’s rendition of the song became his first number-one single on Hot Country Songs in 1991, while “Blame It on Texas”, “Your Love Is a Miracle”, and “Broken Promise Land” all peaked within the top ten of the same chart by year’s end. Contributing musicians to Too Cold at Home included Richard Bennett, David Briggs, Mark O’Connor, Hargus “Pig” Robbins, Matt Rollings, Brent Rowan, and Glenn Worf. Wright produced the album, provided background vocals on some tracks, and wrote or co-wrote five of its ten tracks, including both “Blame It on Texas” and “Your Love Is a Miracle”. Also included on the album was Chesnutt’s rendition of “Friends in Low Places”, which was released as a single in late 1990 by Garth Brooks.</p><h2>Mark Chesnutt Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mark Chesnutt is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mark Chesnutt</b>'s net worth <strong>$3 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He released his first single in Nashville at the age of 17 and established himself by playing in a traditional style of country.</p><p align=justify>He released his 13th album, Outlaw, in 2010.</p><p align=justify>Chesnutt’s musical style draws mainly from honky-tonk and neotraditional country. Due to both singers hailing from Beaumont, Chesnutt was frequently compared stylistically to George Jones. Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune wrote that he was “a throwback to the inwardly-tough, just-do-it kind of country star they were making back when they minted George Jones, who preceded Chesnutt out of the rough-and-tumble East Texas honky-tonks 40 years ago.” Nash described Chesnutt’s vocal style by saying that he “has a comely, smooth baritone and a supple way of moving through his vocal range”, and a “friendly foghorn” with “earnestness”. Rick Mitchell, writing in The Encyclopedia of Country Music, described Chesnutt as “arguably the strongest pure-country voice to come out of Southeastern Texas since George Jones”, and an uncredited review in People said that Chesnutt “has a natural, George Jonesian sob and enough machismo to get away with going falsetto when he wants.” Chesnutt has cited Merle Haggard, Hank Williams, and Elvis Presley as major influences of his. Mitchell also noted that Chesnutt was able to have success with both ballads and uptempo material such as “Bubba Shot the Jukebox” and “Old Flames Have New Names”, as well as the strong presence of cover songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Some of his songs, such as “It Sure Is Monday” and “Gonna Get a Life”, have featured influences of Cajun music through prominent use of fiddle and accordion.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Chesnutt is known for his neotraditionalist country and honky-tonk influences, with frequent stylistic comparisons to George Jones. He has recorded several cover songs as both singles and album cuts, including covers of Hank Williams Jr., John Anderson, Don Gibson, Conway Twitty, and Charlie Rich. Artists with whom he has collaborated include Jones, Tracy Byrd, Vince Gill, and Alison Krauss. Mark Wright produced all but one of his albums released in the 1990s, while his work since 2005 has been produced by Jimmy Ritchey. Chesnutt has also won two awards from the Country Music Association: the Horizon Award (now known as Best New Artist) and Vocal Event of the Year, both in 1993.</p><p>Chesnutt has been married to the former Tracie Motley since 1992. The two met in a bar, and according to Chesnutt, “She came out there with a guy she was with at the time, and I took her away from him”. The couple have three sons: Waylon, Casey, and Cameron. Waylon was named after Waylon Jennings, who jokingly suggested during the recording sessions for their cover of “Rainy Day Woman” that the then-pregnant Tracie name their child after him. Although Jennings later stated that the suggestion was a joke, Chesnutt decided to choose the name anyway. In late 1995, following Waylon Chesnutt’s birth, Tracie typically stayed home at the couple’s house in Jasper, Texas, while also working as an artist. The birth of his sons also caused Chesnutt to tour less frequently by the end of the 1990s, as he wanted to be able to spend more time with his family.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mark Chesnutt height</b> Not available right now.

Nash stated that he “distanced himself from the pack with an identifiable baritone and a focus on music over image”, and Barry Gilbert of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch similarly stated that he “put the music and his warm, classic-country voice before the image.” Chesnutt stated in a 1996 interview that “I would rather play honky-tonks the rest of my life for $500 a week than be something I’m not.” He noted that during his latter years at Decca and MCA, he was constantly pressured by label heads to record more mainstream-friendly country pop instead of the traditional sounds of his earlier albums, due to the genre’s shift away from neotraditional country having a negative impact on his album sales. He also said that some of the tracks on Savin’ the Honky Tonk were songs that the major labels had rejected, and that he would “rather sell 100,000 albums [of traditional country] than 6 million of some crap that I wasn’t happy with.”</p><p align=justify>Chestnutt’s third album for MCA was Almost Goodbye. Released in 1993, it produced three straight number-one singles on Hot Country Singles & Tracks: “It Sure Is Monday” (also written by Linde), the title track, and “I Just Wanted You to Know”. The album’s final single, a cover of Don Gibson’s 1972 single “Woman (Sensuous Woman)”, was less successful on the charts. The album also became his third to be certified platinum. Brian Mansfield wrote of the album in AllMusic that “Weak material weighs down Chesnutt’s third release, though he still sings them like the most romantic western swinger since George Strait.” He praised the title track for its string section, but criticized the uptempo material as being inferior to “Bubba Shot the Jukebox” and “Old Flames Have New Names”. Nash felt that the album was “class-A honky-tonk, ballad, and Texas swing, delivered by a guy whose instincts are usually as sure as his pitch”, but criticized the lyrics of the closing track “The Will”. Also in 1993, Chesnutt won two awards from the Country Music Association: the Horizon Award, and Vocal Event of the Year for George Jones’ 1992 single “I Don’t Need Your Rockin’ Chair”, which featured Chesnutt as one of several guest vocalists and was awarded to all participants on the song. Following the success of Almost Goodbye, Chesnutt embarked on his first headlining tours in 1994, a move which Chesnutt later said inspired him to focus more on songwriting due to the minimal profitability from touring.</p><h2>Who is Mark Chesnutt Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mark Chesnutt</strong> married to <strong>Tracie Chesnutt </strong>.

In order of release, its singles were “Old Flames Have New Names”, “I’ll Think of Something”, “Bubba Shot the Jukebox”, and “Ol’ Country” (also written by Harden). “I’ll Think of Something”, previously a single for Hank Williams Jr. in 1974, became Chesnutt’s second number-one single on Billboard in 1992. The album included many of the same session musicians as its predecessor, along with guest vocals from George Jones on “Talkin’ to Hank”, and both Alison Krauss and Vince Gill on “It’s Not Over”. The latter was originally recorded by Reba McEntire, while the closing track “Who Will the Next Fool Be?” was originally recorded by Charlie Rich. Chesnutt noted in a 1992 news article in The Tennessean that “Bubba Shot the Jukebox” (written by Dennis Linde) had been released as a single due to high demand from fans, and that he was pleased to have recorded a duet with Jones, whom he considered a musical idol. He also noted that “Bubba Shot the Jukebox” had been serviced “as a joke” by Nashville song promoters and was not taken seriously by other artists, but he felt that the song had potential. Mansfield wrote in AllMusic that the album “heralded the emergence of a Texas voice that contained both the knack for humor… and the depth for heartache”. Nash praised the song variety, highlighting the singles and “It’s Not Over” in particular, but felt that Chesnutt’s voice was “a little too laid back”.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mark Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Country Singer</strong>.
