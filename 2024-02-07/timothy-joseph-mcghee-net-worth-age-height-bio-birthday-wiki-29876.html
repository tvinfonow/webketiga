Who is Timothy Joseph McGhee dating now & how much money does Timothy Joseph McGhee have?</p><h2>Timothy Joseph McGhee Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Timothy Joseph McGhee</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Murderer</strong> who was born on <strong>April 27, 1973</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>McGhee was raised in the neighborhood of Atwater Village, a lower middle class area of Los Angeles consisting of 1.78 square miles just north of downtown Los Angeles along Interstate 5 adjacent to Glendale, California. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, born the year after McGhee, grew up in the neighborhood. Judge Lance Ito, who presided over the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and Michelle Phillips, member of The Mamas & the Papas, both attended John Marshall High School there. Even the entrance to the California Adventure theme 100mphpark at Disneyland was modeled after quaint Atwater Village of the 1940s.</p><p>But a Mexican street gang known as Toonerville, also referred to as Toonerville Rifa 13, AKA: TVR, established roots in the area as early as 1942. As gang activity flourished in Los Angeles in the late-1970s and 1980s, clashes between Toonerville and various rivals, most frequently Thee Rascals 13, AKA: TRS, brought drastic change to the neighborhood. The once dominant Toonerville gang’s territory shrunk by more than 50% as Thee Rascals established themselves in the area of Atwater Village south of Los Feliz Boulevard. Thee Rascals 13 is a predominantly Hispanic street gang that established themselves in the late-1970s which was originally formed by a group of Atwater youths in order to protect themselves from the older, well-established gangs, primarily Toonerville Rifa (TVR), The Avenues (AVES), and Frogtown Rifa (FTR). Though smaller in number, Thee Rascals are just as equally vicious as their older arch nemesis. The crime rate increased in the area, the economy wavered, and ethnic diversity grew. A recent study found that 51.3% of the community of 15,455 are Hispanic, predominantly Mexican and Filipino. Nearly half of residents are immigrants from foreign countries and over half of the 5,000 households earn less than $40,000 annually. There is, however, a modern movement to revitalize the area into its once middle class status.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Timothy Joseph McGhee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lomack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Murderer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Timothy Joseph McGhee ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

At some point in the 1990s McGhee became the gang’s leader or “shot-caller”, demanding absolute loyalty from nearly 200 members, training his legion in calisthenics, target practice, tactics to elude police, and procedures to eliminate rival gang members. Toonerville Rifa 13 members were typically posted, armed with weapons, on three main roads that lead into their turf with cell phones or walkie-talkies for communication. The Toonerville gang’s main source of income was the drug trade, in which members and associates would deal drugs, consisting primarily of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana, and PCP, were dealt out of numerous “trap-houses” operating within the gang’s zone of control. The gang also possessed and sold an arsenal of weapons ranging from handguns to AK-47s.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Timothy Joseph McGhee height</b> Not available right now.
