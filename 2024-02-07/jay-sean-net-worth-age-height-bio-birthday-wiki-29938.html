Who is Jay Sean dating now & how much money does Jay Sean have?</p><h2>Jay Sean Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jay Sean</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>R&B Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>March 26, 1981</strong> in London, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. British R&B singer-songwriter whose debut album, Me Against Myself, was released in 2004. He has released singles like “Dance With You” and “Maybe.”</p><p>He has performed with <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>.</p><p>He was a student at Latymer Upper School, the same private school that Hugh Grant, Heston Blumenthal and Lily Cole had attended. He left the school in 1997. He finished his GCSEs as a “straight-A student” and then completed his A Levels with an A grade in Biology and B grades in Mathematics and Chemistry. He later enrolled in Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary, University of London, to study Medicine before he dropped out in 2003 to pursue a singing career. For his music career, he chose the stage name Jay Sean; “Jay” being his nickname, while “Sean” is derived from “Shaan”—a nickname he was called at home by his grandmother—which means “shining star” or “pride” in Punjabi.</p><p>After Sean’s track “One Minute” fell into the hands of producer Rishi Rich, the Rishi Rich Project was formed (consisting of Rich, Sean and Juggy D) in 2003. Their first taste of UK chart success was the Asian underground song, “Dance with You (Nachna Tere Naal)”, which became a Top 20 hit, peaking at #12. This led to Sean signing a £1m deal with Virgin Records, under their label Relentless Records. His second single, “Eyes on You,” was his first solo effort and became a Top 10 hit, peaking at #6. His third single, “Stolen,” peaked at #4, with Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu making an appearance in the video. His debut album, Me Against Myself, was released in 2004 and received much critical praise and acclaim. Sean was referred to as an “Asian sensation” and was praised for his experimental, creative fusion of contemporary R&B, British hip hop and Indian music. The title track in particular was considered innovative, featuring two alter egos of himself, one an R&B singer and the other a rapper, clashing in a rap battle.</p><p align=justify>He started becoming involved in music when he was eleven years old. He has a brother who is a photographer. He married Thara Natalie in 2009; they welcomed a daughter named Ayva in 2013 and a son named Aaryan in 2018.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jay Sean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jay</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Thara Prashad</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jay Sean ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He made a brief appearance in the 2005 Bollywood film Kyaa Kool Hai Hum, providing the song “Dil Mera (My Heart)” to the soundtrack, based on “One Night” from his own debut album. Beyond India, the album sold over 300,000 copies across other parts of the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Hong Kong. His performance of tracks from Me Against Myself on MTV Asia (alongside the Rishi Rich Project) had a television audience as large as 165 million viewers.

With his debut album, Sean was influential in popularising Indian-R&B fusion sounds in Asian underground and Indian pop music.
