As Cueball Carmichael, he was billed as the “hometown hero” of Alexandria, Virginia though he largely wrestled as an unpopular “rulebreaker” for much of his career. He also worked part-time as a stockbroker and insurance broker. After spending over ten years on the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast independent circuit, Jackson began running wrestling shows for the Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance with Kevin Carson. As well as being a part owner and booker, he was also an active wrestler for the promotion. On October 9, 1995, he became its first heavyweight champion at their debut show in Manassas, Virginia.</p><p>He formed successful tag teams with several independent wrestlers during the 1990s including The Darkside Rebel, Mad Dog O’Malley, Jimmy Cicero and sometimes rival Johnny Gunn. As one-half of The Northern Exposure with C.W. Anderson, he won the SCW Tag Team Championship in 1997.

He also continued feuding with Gunn over the title throughout the year, including meeting him in a best-of-three “Texas Death Match” on June 6, and finally regained the title on July 29. Jackson defended the title almost four months, including an outdoor show in Buxton during Hurricane Edouard, before eventually vacating the title due to injury on November 22, 1996. He also had a brief feud with Axl Rotten around this time.</p><p>On March 9, 1996, shortly after a successful title defense against The Iron Sheik at Fairfax County’s Secret’s Restaurant and Sports Arena, Jackson was attacked by Johnny Gunn who hit him across the back with a steel chair. A month later, he lost the title to Gunn after being pinned in a controversial 32 minute match. Jackson later claimed that Gunn had rendered him unconscious with an ether-soaked rag. Sometime during the match however, 22-year-old fan Danelle Evans stole the heavyweight title but it was later recovered by local police.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Cueball Carmichael height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Daisuke <strong>weight</strong> <strong>118&nbsp;kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>118&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As a member of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Shallal was also personally offended by the scheduled appearance of The Iron Sheik and added that the event was unfit for a public school because The Iron Sheik promoted anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiments. When the promotion agreed to drop The Iron Sheik from the event, the ADC made a second complaint about midget wrestling. The school district eventually decided to cancel the event, along with a second show, and notified co-promoter Kevin Heilbronner by letter. The promotion cited that it had previously attracted an audience of 950 at Fairfax High School in December 1995.</p><p align=justify>In September 1997, Jackson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the IPWA against the Fairfax County School Board and Chantilly High School Principal Dale Rumberger. The purpose of the lawsuit was to recoup $15,000 lost by the promotion as a result of a breach of contract. The IPWA had been invited to hold an event to raise money for the Chantilly High School marketing class when it was abruptly cancelled by the Fairfax County school system. This was due to a complaint by Andy Shallal, an official involved in Fairfax County’s diversity training program, who was offended by what he described as “ethnic stereotyping” in flyers featuring Salvatore Sincere, “Wiseguy” Jimmy Cicero and Doink the Clown. As head of the School Board’s human relations advisory committee, Shallal decided to protest the event after receiving a promotional flier from a parent at the school. The fliers were made by the marketing students who had sold ads to advertise and promote the event.</p><h2>Who is Cueball Carmichael Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Cueball Carmichael</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
