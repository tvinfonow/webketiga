Who is Marion Jones dating now & how much money does Marion Jones have?</p><h2>Marion Jones Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Marion Jones</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Runner</strong> who was born on <strong>October 12, 1975</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>. American athlete who took home three gold as well as two bronze awards in the 2000 Sydney Olympics However, she was required to surrender all three after admitting to using steroids.</p><p>She was protected by the famed Laywer from O.J.&nbsp;Simpson, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. against doping charges in high school.</p><p>Marion Jones was born to George Jones and his wife, Marion, (originally from Belize) in Los Angeles, California. She holds dual citizenship with the United States and Belize. Her parents split when she was very young, and Jones’s mother remarried a retired postal worker, Ira Toler, three years later. Toler became a stay-at-home dad to Jones and her older half-brother, Albert Kelly, until his sudden death in 1987. Jones turned to sports as an outlet for her grief; running, pickup basketball games, and anything else her brother Albert was doing athletically. By the age of 15 she was routinely dominating California high school athletics both on the track and the basketball court.</p><p>Throughout most of her athletic career including two Olympiads and several championship meets, Jones had been accused, either outright or by implication, of taking performance-enhancing drugs. These accusations began in high school in the early 1990s when she missed a random drug test and consequently was banned for four years from track and field competition. (Jones claimed she never received the letter notifying her of the required test; attorney Johnnie Cochran successfully got the four-year ban overturned.) Soon, it became apparent that Jones tended to train with both coaches and athletes who themselves were dogged by rumors and accusations surrounding performance-enhancing drugs. And yet until 2007, Jones routinely denied—in almost every way possible and in almost any venue where the question arose—ever being involved with performance enhancers in any way, shape, or form. She frequently said that she had never tested positive for performance-enhancing substances; in her autobiography, she blamed the 2002 breakup of her marriage to C.J. Hunter in part on the fact that Hunter had tested positive for steroids four times before the 2000 Olympics, tainting her own drug-free image.</p><p align=justify>They were married CJ Hunter who was her track and field coach from UNC from 1998 until 2002.&nbsp;They had a son, She was married to CJ Hunter, her former track coach at UNC, from 1998 to 2002.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Marion Jones celebrates birthday on October 12 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, Jones declared that she intended to win gold medals in all five of her competition events at Sydney. Jones’ husband, C.J. Hunter, had withdrawn from the shot-put competition for a knee injury, though he was allowed to keep his coaching credentials and attend the games to support his wife. However, just hours after Marion Jones won her first of the planned five golds, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that Hunter had failed four pre-Olympic drug tests, testing positive each time for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone. Hunter was immediately suspended from taking any role at the Sydney games, and he was ordered to surrender his on-field coaching credentials. At a press conference where Hunter broke down in tears, he denied taking any performance-enhancing drugs, much less the easily detected nandrolone (which showed up in all four tests in amounts over 1000 times normal levels); Victor Conte of BALCO, who was regularly supplying “nutritional supplements” to athletes trained by Trevor Graham, blamed the test results on “an iron supplement” that contained nandrolone precursors and tied previous positive nandrolone tests from Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey and British sprinter Linford Christie to the same supplement. As late as 2004, Hunter was still denying the charges and attempting to gain access to the results to see if they could be analyzed further. Jones would later write in her autobiography, Marion Jones: Life in the Fast Lane, that Hunter’s positive drug tests hurt their marriage and her image as a drug-free athlete. The couple divorced in 2002.</p><h3>Why was Marion Jones stripped of medals?</h3><p>Jones pleaded guilty in 2008 to <b>lying to federal investigators about her use of performance-enhancing drugs</b>.
