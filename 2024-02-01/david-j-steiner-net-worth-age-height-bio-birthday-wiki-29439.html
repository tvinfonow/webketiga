Steiner (February 2 1965 – December 26 January 26, David J. Steiner (February 2, 1965 – December 26,) was an American documentary filmmaker teacher, rabbi, educator mediator, investor in real estate and political activist most well-known for his documentary film Saving Barbara Sizemore (2016).</p><p>David Steiner was a prolific writer of screenplays, blog posts and academic writings.&nbsp;His blog, The Radish: The Beet with David Steiner which ran over six years (2008-2014) and, in the blog, Steiner discussed a variety of issues in relation to issues that were close to his heart Peace in the Middle East, the refugee crisis, Israeli politics, mediation baseball, and many more.&nbsp;The blog’s name was taken from the initial letter of his first name Rabbi doctor Shteiner.&nbsp;Israel was always at the forefront of Steiner’s thoughts and his writings reflect his support for an open and inclusive Jewish country, one that was built on tolerance, democracy and values that are progressive.</p><p>After earning his art degree at UCLA, Steiner returned to Chicago and soon thereafter moved back to Israel, where he married and had three children. He continued his creative efforts in Israel, developing CD-ROM and video content for a multimedia company, Hed Arzi Music, and teaching. Steiner strongly believed that the best way to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict was to find ways to get Israeli and Palestinian youth together to create art, play sports and have constructive dialog, so he started an organization that brought together Israeli and Palestinian youth. It was at this time that Steiner’s son befriended some refugees from South Sudan, which formed the inspiration for the documentary Steiner was working on at the time of his death in Africa in 2016.</p><p>This spurred Steiner to action, and he contacted his friend and UCLA film school classmate, David Bret Egen. He and Egen decided to make a documentary film about the refugee crisis, one that would incorporate the stories of his son’s South Sudanese friends into a new documentary, to be filmed in the United States, Israel and Uganda, where the South Sudanese boys were living after their removal from Israel—away from their parents, who were living in war-torn Juba, South Sudan.</p><p align=justify>Steiner was a first-time supporter of Barack Obama, and in February of 2007, he travelled in Springfield, Illinois in freezing cold temperatures to witness Obama announce his candidacy for president at an outdoor gathering.&nbsp;In the 2016 presidential election the senator was an avid supporter of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.&nbsp;At the close the course of his career, Steiner also actively supported protests against the brutality of police, particularly those involving police-involved killings of African-Americans who were not armed.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David J.
