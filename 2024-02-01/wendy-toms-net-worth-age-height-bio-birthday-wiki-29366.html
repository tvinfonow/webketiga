According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Wendy Toms</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Toms began refereeing in the latter part of the 1980s. She became an reserve (now “fourth”) official in the Football League in 1991 for the Bournemouth match between Bournemouth and Reading match played in the Third Division, which was in the beginning a first for a female.&nbsp;Toms was the first female to be added to the roster of Football League assistant referees when she was appointed in 1994 for the 1995 season and was appointed a referee for the Football Conference two seasons later setting a precedent again when she was appointed referee for the match of Kidderminster as well as Nuneaton Borough in her debut Conference match as a referee.&nbsp;About a year later she became As an assistant referee within the Premier League, again, being the first female to hold this position.</p><p align=justify>Two years after her first appearance in the league, and after having ‘crossed the line in support of Referee Steve Dunn during Leeds United’s 4-3 Premiership away victory against Coventry City on 11 September 1999, she was widely critiqued by the former Coventry director, Gordon Strachan, who spoke to The Independent newspaper: “We are getting PC decisions about promoting ladies. It does not matter if they are ladies, men or Alsatian dogs. If they are not good enough to run the line they should not get the job. Saturday’s was the worst assistant refereeing decision I have seen this season by far and I’ve said that in my report. The fourth Leeds goal was offside by at least four yards and there were numerous other bad decisions in the game. My message is don’t be politically correct and promote people just for the sake of it.”&nbsp;But the head of the Association of Referees that day, Peter Willis, replied: “She’s a very good official…I think the situation is very sad. As a manager of a football club, Strachan is responsible for his players and he is entitled to his opinion on the performance of the officials, but to talk about the sex of the official is irrelevant.”</p><p align=justify>Toms refereed one match at the 2005 UEFA Women’s Championship in England. This was the Group B match at Deepdale in Preston on 6 June 2005, between France and Italy, which finished 3-1 to the French.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Referee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Wendy Toms height</b> Not available right now.
