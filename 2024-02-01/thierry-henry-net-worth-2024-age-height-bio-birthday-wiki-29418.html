Who is Thierry Henry dating now & how much money does Thierry Henry have?</p><h2>Thierry Henry Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Thierry Henry</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Soccer Player</strong> who was born on <strong>August 17, 1977</strong> in Les Ulis, Île-de-France, <strong>France</strong>. A star French striker who was a part of France’s national side for more than 10 years and also was a part of Arsenal as well as FC Barcelona during the height of his career. He was a part of the New York Red Bulls in the MLS in the year 2010.</p><p>He made a strong friendship with his fellow French sportsman&nbsp;He developed a close friendship with fellow French athlete <a href=#>Tony Parker</a>..</p><p>Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He was born and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry’s future mentor, followed him there.</p><p>One of the reasons cited for Henry’s impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten. He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry’s ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: “I have to say I haven’t seen a player like him. He’s an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.”</p><p align=justify>He was engaged to Claire Merry until their divorce in 2007.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thierry Henry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thierry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Les Ulis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Île-de-France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Claire Merry</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Téa Henry, Tristan Henry, Tatiana Henry</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Thierry Henry ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

However, limited playing time, led to him signing for English club Arsenal for £11&nbsp;million in 1999. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal’s all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times, won two FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club, including one during an unbeaten season dubbed The Invincibles. He spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. In June 2007, he transferred to Barcelona. In the 2008-09 season, he was a key part of the club’s historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. In 2010, he joined New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer (MLS). He returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014.</p><h2>Thierry Henry Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Thierry Henry is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from France.

He is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time and has often been debated by pundits and journalists as the greatest player in the history of the Premier League. In 2003 and 2004, Henry was the runner-up for the FIFA World Player of the Year, and was runner-up for the Ballon d’Or in the former year. He was named the PFA Players’ Player of the Year twice, the FWA Footballer of the Year three times, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six-times in a row. He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times.

During the 1997–98 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final, setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition. By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team, and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the French club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.</p><p>Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team, winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet. Within four months, France head coach Aimé Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against South Africa. Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France’s top scorer with three goals. He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3–0, but Marcel Desailly’s sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d’honneur, France’s highest decoration.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Thierry Henry height</b> Not available right now.

Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite INF Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director’s reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger’s Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.</p><p align=justify>Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth, he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal’s formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal’s main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: “Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score”.</p><h2>Who is Thierry Henry Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Thierry Henry</strong> married to <strong>Claire Merry </strong>.

Thierry Henry celebrates birthday on August 17 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of £11&nbsp;million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee. Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games. After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to “be re-taught everything about the art of striking.” These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 30 yards out. The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser “Whassup?” advertisement. Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Turkish club Galatasaray.</p><h3>Did Thierry Henry win a Ballon d Or?</h3><p>Second in 2003 and third in 2006, the masterful Thierry Henry was <b>never able to get his hands on the Ballon d’Or</b> throughout his fantastic career.</p><h3>Is Henry better than Ronaldo?</h3><p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo beats Thierry Henry in the final round</b> The final voting round pitted Cristiano Ronaldo against Thierry Henry.</p><h3>Is Thierry Henry African?</h3><p><b>Despite being born in France, Thierry Henry’s entire family is from the French Antilles</b>.
