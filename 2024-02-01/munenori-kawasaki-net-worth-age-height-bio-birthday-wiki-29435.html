Who is Munenori Kawasaki dating now & how much money does Munenori Kawasaki have?</p><h2>Munenori Kawasaki Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Munenori Kawasaki</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Baseball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>June 3, 1981</strong> in Aira, Kagoshima Prefecture, <strong>Japan</strong>. He is a Japanese baseball player, best known for his eight-time All Star performance in the Nippon Professional Baseball League.&nbsp;In 2012, he made his MLB debut for the Seattle Mariners.</p><p>Both he and&nbsp;Ichiro Suzu&nbsp;were both MLB players who started in Japan.</p><p>Kawasaki remained largely an unknown on the national level during his high school career, partly due to his team’s failing to make any national tournaments in those three years. Still, he made a name for himself locally, earning the nickname Satsurō, a portmanteau derived from Satsuma (the name given to a former province of Japan in present-day western Kagoshima) and former Seattle Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki’s first name for the similarities in their playing styles. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1999 NPB amateur draft by the then-Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.</p><p>Kawasaki earned the starting shortstop job for the Hawks’ nigun team (Japanese for “minor league” or “farm team”) in his rookie season (2000), hitting .300 and finishing fifth in the Western League in batting average that year. In 2001, his second season in the pros, he came second (to only then-Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles outfielder Akihito Moritani) with 29 stolen bases. He made his debut at the ichigun (major league) level on October 3 against the Orix BlueWave as the starting shortstop and No. 2 hitter, but went hitless in four at-bats that year.</p><p align=justify>In 2013, his son Issho was birthed.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Munenori Kawasaki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Munenori</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kawasaki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aira</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kagoshima Prefecture</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Munenori Kawasaki ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 2003, Kawasaki started in the Hawks’ season opener for the first time in his career because of injuries to veteran Yusuke Torigoe, starting at shortstop as the team’s No. 2 hitter. After Torigoe returned to the lineup, Kawasaki moved over to third base, wreaking havoc on the basepaths along with leadoff hitter Arihito Muramatsu and Iguchi (who sat in the 3-hole). He hit his first career home run on July 28 off Buffaloes right-hander Ken Kadokura, and while he finished the season just short of .300, he played his first full season at the ichigun level and hit .294 with two homers, 51 RBI and 30 steals, playing a key role in the Hawks’ league title and eventual Japan Series championship.</p><h2>Munenori Kawasaki Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Munenori Kawasaki is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from Japan. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Munenori Kawasaki</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>During his first season as a Hawks member, he hit.300.</p><p align=justify>He was twice awarded the Best Nine Award in the NPBL for shortstops.</p><p align=justify>Munenori Kawasaki (川﨑 宗則 , Kawasaki Munenori, born June 3, 1981) is a retired Japanese professional baseball shortstop and second baseman. He has played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, and in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, and Chicago Cubs. He played for the Japanese national team in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as well as the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classics. Following the Chicago Cubs’ 2016 World Series championship, Kawasaki joined Daisuke Matsuzaka and Koji Uehara as the only Japanese players to have won championships in the World Baseball Classic, Japan Series and World Series.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Listed at 5&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in (1.80&nbsp;m) and 175&nbsp;lb (79&nbsp;kg), Kawasaki is best described as a slap hitter, utilizing his exceptional bat control and speed to get on base (often bunting safely to do so). However, he is somewhat lacking in power, even for a middle infielder, having never hit more than four home runs (2004, 2005, 2007) or recorded more than 31 extra-base hits (2004, 2006) for a season.</p><p>Kawasaki became the Hawks’ starting shortstop for the 2004 season, playing in all 133 regular season games and hitting over .300 for the first time in his career. He led the league in both hits (174, tied with teammate and cleanup hitter Nobuhiko Matsunaka) and steals (42) and was chosen to both the Best Nine and Golden Glove awards. Kawasaki declined the team’s offer to change his uniform number from 52 to 8 during the off-season. (The number is an homage to Ichiro Suzuki, who wears the number 51; Kawasaki idolized Suzuki from a young age and picked the number because he wanted to “follow” in Suzuki’s footsteps.)</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Munenori Kawasaki height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Munenori <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Kawasaki hit .367 in the Western League the following year (2002), winning the batting title despite falling short of the required number of plate appearances because of league regulations. He got the first hit of his career on June 15 against right-hander Jeremy Powell, then of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, and his first stolen base on June 19 against the Seibu Lions. He was called up to the ichigun team again in September to fill in for Tadahito Iguchi as the team’s regular second baseman while Iguchi missed time due to injury and also played in the 15th IBAF International Cup as a member of the Japanese national team.</p><p align=justify>Coming off a championship in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, Kawasaki bounced back in 2006, hitting a career-high .312 and winning the Pacific League Best Nine and Golden Glove awards at shortstop (each for the second time). He also received the most fan votes at shortstop for the MLB Japan All-Star Series held in November, but withdrew from the tournament after injuring the ring finger on his right hand during Fall Training.</p><h2>Who is Munenori Kawasaki Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Munenori Kawasaki</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
