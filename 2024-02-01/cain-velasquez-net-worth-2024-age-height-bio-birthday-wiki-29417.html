After the fight, Dana White strongly hinted that Velasquez would be the next fighter to challenge for the UFC Heavyweight Championship. It is widely thought that the reason White made the decision to have the rematch with Dos Santos at such an unexpected time, was because of the fact that both fighters were injured going into their first fight.</p><h2>Who is Cain Velasquez Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Cain Velasquez</strong> married to <strong>Michelle Velasquez </strong>.
