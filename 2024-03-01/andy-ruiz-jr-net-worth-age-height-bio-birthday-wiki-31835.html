Who is Andy Ruiz Jr. dating now & how much money does Andy Ruiz Jr. have?</p><h2>Andy Ruiz Jr. Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Andy Ruiz Jr.</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Boxer</strong> who was born on <strong>September 11, 1989</strong> in California, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Mexican-American professional boxer who is known for having been the Super WBA, WBO, IBO, and IBF Heavyweight champion. He gained international recognition in June of 2019 when he defeated <a href=#>Anthony Joshua</a> with a seven round technical knockout to claim the heavyweight title.</p><p><a href=#>Anthony Joshua</a> posted a picture with <a href=#>Drake</a> through his Instagram prior to the fight. Posting a picture with <a href=#>Drake</a> has resulted in sports curses that have been attributed to the losses of <a href=#>Conor McGregor</a>, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and other athletes. The supposed curse worked in favor of Ruiz.</p><p>On May 14, 2016 Ruiz fought 45 year old, former world title challenger Ray Austin (29-6-4, 18 KOs) at the Sportsman’s Lodge in California. Austin weighed 18 pounds more than Ruiz at the weigh-in. This was the first time in 14 professional fights that Ruiz was outweighed by his opponent. This was Ruiz’s fourth successful defence of his WBC-NABF heavyweight title as Austin was down in round one, he injured his right hand and failed to come out of his corner for round five. After this bout, Ruiz increased his record to 27 wins in as many fights.</p><p>His next fight was scheduled to take place on July 7, 2018 at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California against veteran journeyman Kevin Johnson (32-9-1, 16 KOs). The main goal for this bout was for Ruiz to get in some much needed rounds, having only completed less than a round in over a year. Johnson, who had previously only been stopped twice in his nine losses, was known for his toughness, having taken the likes of Kubrat Pulev, Dereck Chisora, Tyson Fury and Vitali Klitschko, the twelve round distance. Ruiz dominated Johnson over ten rounds, winning via unanimous decision with scores of 99–91, 97–93, and 97–93. Johnson did not do much apart from throw a strong jab from time to time. It was Ruiz who was busy and remained in control for majority of the bout. Ruiz admitted it was good to go the distance and called out some of the better heavyweights, namely Jarrell Miller.</p><p align=justify>He was born and raised in Imperial Valley, California. He is married and has five children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andy Ruiz Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marcella</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Althaus-Reid</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Andrés Ruiz</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andy Ruiz Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
