According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Joe Strummer</b>'s net worth <strong>$4 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was first a lead singer of The Welsh group The Vultures at age 21.</p><p align=justify>He was admitted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.</p><p align=justify>He also used three Fender Esquire models, one from 1952, a white blonde with slab fretboard from the mid-1950s and another from early to mid-1960s with a white pick guard and rosewood fingerboard. The Esquire is a one-pickup version of the Telecaster. Prior to using any Telecaster oriented guitar, before buying his 1966 model, he used as main guitars a Gretsch White Falcon and a 1964 Hofner Verithin. For amplification Strummer was known to use amplifiers such as a Roland Jazz Chorus, a Selmer Bassman while he was in the 101ers, a Vox AC30 and various Marshall amplifiers, but his main amplifier was a Music Man HD 212,150. Strummer commented on his choice of amplifier with “I don’t have time to search for those old Fender tube amps. The Music Man is the closest thing to that sound I’ve found” and that the “plastic motif on the front is repulsive.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By 1970 his brother David had become estranged from his family. His suicide in July profoundly affected Strummer, as did having to identify his body after it had lain undiscovered for three days.</p><p>In 1973 Strummer moved to Newport, Wales. He did not study at Newport College of Art but met up with college musicians in the Students’ Union in Stow Hill and became vocalist for Flaming Youth, renaming the band the Vultures. The Vultures included three former members of Rip Off Park Rock & Roll Allstars, the original college band co-founded by Terry Earl Taylor. For the next year he was the band’s part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time Strummer also worked as a gravedigger in St Woolos Cemetery. Whilst in Newport he wrote and recorded on an old reel to reel tape recorder “Crumby Bum Blues” which was later used in Julien Temple’s 2007 film. In 1974, the band fell apart and he moved back to London where he met up again with Tymon Dogg. He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his West London roommates. The band was called the 101ers, named after the address of their squat (101 Walterton Road, in Maida Vale).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Joe Strummer height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Joe <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Strummer’s main guitar throughout his career was a 1966 Fender Telecaster that he acquired in its original sunburst finish during the middle of 1975, when he was playing with the 101ers. After joining the Clash, the guitar’s body and pickguard were refinished in grey auto primer and then painted black. Over the years, the guitar would see numerous sticker configurations, with the most prominent and longest-lasting one stating “Ignore Alien Orders”. Years of heavy wear and taped on set lists remain on the guitar to this day, and the only known modifications to it included the installation of an individual, 6-saddle bridge, and Fender “f-style” tuning machines.</p><p align=justify>The band played many gigs in London pubs, playing covers of popular American R&B and blues songs. In 1975 he stopped calling himself “Woody” Mellor and adopted the stage name of Joe Strummer, and insisted that his friends call him by that name. The name “Strummer” apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist, in a rather self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by his girlfriend at the time, Slits drummer Palmolive. The group liked the song “Keys to Your Heart”, and picked it as their first single.</p><h2>Who is Joe Strummer Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Joe Strummer</strong> married to <strong>Lucinda Tait </strong>.
