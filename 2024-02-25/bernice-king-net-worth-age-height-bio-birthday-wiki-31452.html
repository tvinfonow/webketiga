Youngest child of <a href=#>Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> who was the CEO of The King Center and served as a Baptist minister.</p><p>She delivered a speech following the passing of South African leader <a href=#>Nelson Mandela</a>.</p><p>Bernice Albertine King was born on March 28, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia. The day after she was born, her father had to leave for Birmingham, Alabama, but he rushed back when it was time for Bernice and her mother, Coretta, to leave the hospital. He drove them home himself but, in what was all too typical with the work he was doing, had to leave them again within hours. Following her birth, Harry Belafonte realized the toll the Civil Rights Movement was taking on her mother’s time and energy and offered to pay for a nurse to help Coretta with the Kings’ four children. They accepted and hired a person that would help with the children for the next five or six years. Her father died a week after Bernice’s fifth birthday.</p><p>Bernice Albertine King (born March 28, 1963) is an American minister and the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King.

At that age, she saw Montgomery to Memphis, a documentary film on her father’s life from the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 to his assassination in 1968, and “went through almost two hours of crying” and questioning. She had seen the film many times growing up, but the particular viewing “triggered an emotional explosion that later would thrust her into the arms of a loving God.” King reflected: “When I saw the funeral scene, I just broke down. I ran out of the cabin into the woods, and for nearly 2-1/2 hours, I just cried.” She credited the viewing with influencing her to become a minister like her father, who served as a minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Religious Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>King was arrested with her mother Coretta and her brother Martin Luther King III on June 26, 1985 with the offense of demonstrating in front of an embassy.

The sermon’s theme was “You’ve Got To Rise Above The Crowd.” King said her decision to deliver the sermon as “affirming a call I received at 17.” She also said, “At some point in our lives, comes the moment of decision. For me, that moment is now. I submit myself totally to the will of God.” Andrew Young, who attended the sermon, compared her style to her father’s and noted their similarities while calling listening to her speak “a very emotional occasion for me.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bernice King height</b> Not available right now.
