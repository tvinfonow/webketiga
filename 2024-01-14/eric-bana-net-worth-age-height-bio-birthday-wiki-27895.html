Soon afterwards he gained critical recognition in the biographical crime film Chopper (2000). After a decade of roles in Australian TV shows and films, Bana gained Hollywood’s attention for his performance in the war film Black Hawk Down (2001) and the title character in Hulk (2003). He has since played Hector in the movie Troy (2004), the lead in Steven Spielberg’s historical drama and political thriller Munich (2005), Henry VIII in The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), and the villain Nero in the science-fiction film Star Trek (2009).

Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.</p><p>In 2001, director Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American soldier in the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana’s performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm ‘Hoot’ Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights his way out of a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began.

His performance gained the attention of producers from the sketch comedy series, Full Frontal, who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer. During his four years on the show, Bana wrote much of his own material, and based some of his characters on members of his family. His impressions of Columbo, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Tom Cruise made Bana popular with the show’s audience. This success led him to record the comedy album Out of Bounds in 1994 and to host his own television special, titled Eric, in 1996. The show, a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters, prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series The Eric Bana Show. The series, written and performed by Bana, featured skits, stand-up and celebrity guests, but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings. Even so, in 1997, he received a Logie Award for “Most Popular Comedy Personality” for his work on the show.</p><p align=justify>Bana’s next project was the low-budget Australian film The Nugget (2002). A comedy, the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working-class men and was released with moderate success in Australia. Bana read the script after filming Chopper in 2000 and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood and because he found its characters amusing and likeable. While filming The Nugget, Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular Marvel Comic book series The Incredible Hulk. Only after learning of director Ang Lee’s involvement in the project did he consider the role. Bana admired Lee for his work on the film The Ice Storm and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete. He said he was drawn to the film because “the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential” and was “a fairly non-traditional superhero”. Although Hulk (2003) received mixed reviews and was a moderate success at the box office, Bana’s performance was highly praised: Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner “with great conviction”. Bana earned an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for “Cinescape Genre Face of the Future” for the film. In 2003, he voiced hammerhead shark Anchor in the critically and commercially acclaimed animated Pixar film Finding Nemo.</p><h2>Who is Eric Bana Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Eric Bana</strong> married to <strong>Rebecca Gleeson </strong>.
