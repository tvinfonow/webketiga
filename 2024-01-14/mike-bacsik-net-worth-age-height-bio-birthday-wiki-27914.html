Who is Mike Bacsik dating now & how much money does Mike Bacsik have?</p><h2>Mike Bacsik Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mike Bacsik</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Baseball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>November 11, 1977</strong> in Dallas, Dallas, <strong>United States</strong>. Michael Joseph Bacsik (/ˈ b æ s ɪ k / ; born November 11, 1977) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher and current radio host. Bacsik is particularly notable for having given up Barry Bonds’ 756th career home run on August 7, 2007, which broke the all-time record formerly held by Hank Aaron. Bacsik is the son of Michael James Bacsik, who pitched in the majors from 1975–1980.</p><p>Two months later, on December 23, 2003, Bacsik signed a contract with the Texas Rangers (incidentally, the team where his father was a member when he was born). He spent most of the 2004 season with the Oklahoma Redhawks, the Rangers’ Triple-A affiliate. He made just three starts in 2004 for the big league club, going 1-1 with a 4.60 ERA.</p><p>Bacsik became a free agent after the 2006 season and later signed another minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on November 6, 2006. He did not make the major league team when the Nationals broke camp and started with the Columbus Clippers, the Nationals’ Triple-A team. After the Nationals found themselves with four of their five starting pitchers on the disabled list, Bacsik and other pitchers were brought up from their farm system. Despite a record of 1-3 and a 4.00 ERA with Columbus (and an ERA of 5.26 as a starter), Bacsik made his debut with the Nationals on May 19, throwing six shutout innings in a game the Nats eventually lost. In his following start, he pitched 7.2 innings, his longest outing of the year including the minors, allowing three runs and earning his first win in the majors since August 4, 2004. He did not miss a start in the rotation after his last callup until he was sent to the bullpen and went 5-8 with a 5.11 ERA in 20 starts and nine relief appearances.</p><p>He signed a contract with the Washington Nationals on February 9, 2006, with an invitation to spring training. He made just one start in spring training and gave up six runs in 0.2 innings before getting cut in April. Afterwards, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had an impressive minor league season with the Diamondbacks’ Triple-A team, the Tucson Sidewinders, in which he went a perfect 11-0 with a 2.79 ERA in 28 games (10 starts).</p><p align=justify>Bacsik was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 18th round (543rd overall) in the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. He was in his sixth minor league season with the Indians organization before making his debut on August 5, 2001. He was supposed to be serving mop-up duty, as the Seattle Mariners had opened up a huge lead on the Indians. He was knocked around at first and settled in. The Indians rallied from 12 runs down to win the game in extra innings. Bacsik had a 9.00 ERA in three relief appearances (9 innings) in 2001.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Bacsik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dallas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dallas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mike Bacsik</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sue Myers</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Bacsik ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

During the post-home run celebration, Bacsik tipped his cap to Bonds in a gesture of respect. He visited the Giants clubhouse to personally congratulate Bonds on his achievement, and Bonds gave Bacsik an autographed bat that read: “To Mike, God Bless. Barry Bonds.” Coincidentally, Bacsik’s father had faced Aaron (as a pitcher for the Texas Rangers) after Aaron had hit his 755th home run. On August 23, 1976, Michael James Bacsik held Aaron to a single and a fly out to right field. The younger Bacsik commented later, “If my dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, we both would have given up 756.”</p><p>Bacsik made offensive comments on his Twitter account following the loss of the Dallas Mavericks to the San Antonio Spurs in game 4 of the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs. The comments, most notably “Congratulations to all the dirty Mexicans in San Antonio,” quickly circulated on social networks online before Bacsik deleted the comments. The following Monday, on April 26, 2010, Bacsik was suspended indefinitely from his KTCK duties by owner Cumulus Media for “comments [that] were unacceptable and offensive, and are inconsistent with the core values of KTCK and Cumulus.” The next day, Bacsik was fired by The Ticket.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mike Bacsik height</b> Not available right now.
