Who is Ed "Too Tall" Jones dating now & how much money does Ed "Too Tall" Jones have?</p><h2>Ed "Too Tall" Jones Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ed "Too Tall" Jones</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>American Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>February 23, 1951</strong> in Jackson, Tennessee, <strong>United States</strong>. Ed Lee Jones (born February 23, 1951), commonly known as Ed “Too Tall” Jones due to his height, is a retired American football player who played 15 seasons (1974–1978, 1980–1989) in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. In 1979, he briefly left football to attempt a career in professional boxing.</p><p>The Meneses bout was the only one of Jones’ fights he would not win by knockout. But his other five opponents were journeymen at best, with the arguable exception of Mexican heavyweight champ Fernando Montes, whom Jones knocked out in just 44 seconds on November 24, 1979. After his last ring appearance on January 26, 1980, Jones announced he would return to play for the Dallas Cowboys. In a 2016 interview, Jones called boxing his favorite sport and said that fighting “was probably the best decision [he] ever made,” because his boxing training regimen made him a better football player.</p><p>He returned to play for the 1980 season, replacing John Dutton at defensive end and performing better than his first stint with the team.</p><p>Jones earned All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors three times from 1981 to 1983. He retired at the end of the 1989 season, having never missed a game, playing the most games by any Cowboys player (232) and being tied with Mark Tuinei and Bill Bates for most seasons (15).</p><p align=justify>He became a starter at left defensive end during his second season in 1975 and by 1977 he had helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XII. After playing five years for the Cowboys from 1974 through 1978, Jones at 28 years old and in the prime of his athletic career, left football to attempt a professional boxing career.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed "Too Tall" Jones</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fernando</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marroquin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American football player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jackson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennessee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ed "Too Tall" Jones ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ed "Too Tall" Jones</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>The 6&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in (2.06&nbsp;m) Jones received his famous nickname during his first football practice, after a teammate mentioned that his pants did not fit, because he was “too tall to play football”. In his new sport, he became a two-time All-American defensive lineman, playing on a team that only lost two games, en route to winning the black college football national championship in 1971 and 1973.</p><p align=justify>In the 1974 NFL Draft, for the first time in their history, the Dallas Cowboys had the first overall draft choice. The No. 1 selection was acquired from the Houston Oilers in exchange for Tody Smith and Billy Parks. The Cowboys ended up drafting Jones, making him the first football player from a historically black college to go that high in the NFL draft.</p><p align=justify>His pro boxing debut, held in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on November 3, 1979, was controversial. Despite giving away over fifty pounds, opponent Abraham Yaqui Meneses dropped Jones with a left hook in the sixth and final round, then hit him again (illegally) when Jones was down. Jones’ cornerman then entered the ring (also illegally) and attempted to revive his fighter with an ammonia bottle. Referee Buddy Basilico reasoned that since both fighters had broken the rules, he would punish neither of them, and let the fight go on. Jones survived the round and was awarded a narrow majority decision, causing the pro-Meneses crowd to boo loudly.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jones ranks third in school history in sacks in a season (12) and fifth in career sacks (38).
