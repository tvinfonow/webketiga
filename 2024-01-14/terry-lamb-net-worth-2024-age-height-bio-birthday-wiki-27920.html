Lamb was called in at the last moment for a very ill Mick Pattison and only arrived in Brisbane on the day of the match (when Pattison took ill, NSW coach Ted Glossop initially wanted to move Steve Rogers from the centres to five-eighth and play whoever the league gave him as a replacement back from the bench but was overruled by the NSWRL. Lamb, who at the time worked as a linesman for Telecom, was literally found up a telegraph pole and had to make a rushed flight to Brisbane). Lamb met his halves partner, young Parramatta halfback Peter Sterling, for the first time only two hours before kickoff. Lamb made his Origin debut at Lang Park playing opposite another young player on the rise, Queensland captain Wally Lewis who had made his test debut against France only a few weeks earlier. NSW led 15-5 at half time mostly due to the Parramatta connection of Sterling, Ray Price, Michael Cronin and Eric Grothe who picked up a loose Greg Conescu pass to race 90 metres to score in the first half. But the Maroons, led by Lewis and man of the match Chris Close, came back strong in the second half to win 22-15.</p><h2>Terry Lamb Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Terry Lamb is one of the <strong>richest Coach</strong> from Australia.

Lamb ruled himself out of the tour as he already planned to marry his partner Kim. The Kangaroos swept all before them on the tour going through undefeated for the first time and becoming known as “The Invincibles”.</p><p>Lamb’s final season with Wests was in 1983 where the Magpies won the dreaded wooden spoon prize. In spite of this, he was awarded the Dally M Player of the Year Award. His prize winnings of $9,000 that night was $500 more than his contract that season.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Terry Lamb height</b> <strong>1.66&nbsp;m</strong> Terunoumi <strong>weight</strong> <strong>80&nbsp;kg (12&nbsp;st 8&nbsp;lb)</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.66&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>80&nbsp;kg (12&nbsp;st 8&nbsp;lb)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On 18 May 1980, Lamb made his first grade premiership debut for Western Suburbs against Balmain Tigers at Lidcombe Oval.

Lamb’s arrival did cause initial controversy when long-serving five-eighth Garry Hughes was dropped to reserve grade in what was to be his final season. Lamb’s ability to back up the ball-carrier came to the fore as he was the Sydney Premiership’s joint leading tryscorer with 17. Lamb won a recall to the New South Wales State of Origin side for the 2nd match. He played well enough to be retained for the 3rd match despite the Blues losing, but withdrew due to injury. Lamb never won a junior premiership and he was closing in on one at senior level when the Bulldogs made the 1984 Grand Final against arch-rivals Parramatta Eels who were looking to win their fourth successive title. Canterbury took out the Grand Final 6–4 in a bruising game of football.
