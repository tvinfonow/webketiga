With friends on SNL, Richter was able to get into the after-show parties where he met SNL writer Robert Smigel. Two years later, Smigel hired Richter for a new show he was producing, Late Night with Conan O’Brien. Originally hired as a writer, Richter was upgraded to Conan O’Brien’s sidekick just weeks before the show began airing in 1993, after it became clear the two had a strong rapport, something Smigel noticed after sending Richter to join O’Brien on stage during a practice run-through when the production staff was testing lighting angles and sound.</p><h2>Andy Richter Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Andy Richter is one of the <strong>richest TV Show Host</strong> from United States.

His first major venture, Fox’s Andy Richter Controls the Universe, was canceled after two mid-season runs. His next Fox sitcom, Quintuplets, lasted one season. His 2007 television series, Andy Barker P.I., was co-written and executive produced by Conan O’Brien. In the series, Richter played an accountant who could not attract clients. After a woman comes to his office thinking he is the former tenant, a private investigator, she asks him to find her husband who she thinks faked his death. Barker decides to pursue this job and becomes a private detective in earnest, and continues to do his accounting job, which seems to pick up as the series goes on. The series played on NBC, with all six episodes in the first season on NBC.com. The series was canceled after very poor ratings despite being named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007.</p><p>After seven years with the show, Richter departed from Late Night after the show on May 26, 2000. He later said of the decision, “After seven years of being on the show, I got itchy. I have a philosophy that if you enjoy good fortune, rather than sit there and say, ‘Oh, that’s fine, this amount is good enough for me,’ you should try and push it. You should see how much you can stretch your good fortune. And I was curious.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Andy Richter height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Andy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the early 1990s, the Annoyance Theatre hit gold when producer Jill Soloway staged The Real Live Brady Bunch with live, word-for-word performances of the ’70s sitcom. The show was so popular that it attracted national attention and moved to New York City. Richter was not an original member of the cast but the actor who played “Mike Brady” in the Chicago cast opted not to go to New York. Richter asked Soloway if he could play “Mike” in New York and, since Soloway had not cast a replacement, she agreed.</p><p align=justify>In October 2005, Richter appeared in the NBC sitcom Will & Grace.
