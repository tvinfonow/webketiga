Entrepreneur best known as the co-founder and CEO of Twitter. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal named him the Innovator of the Year.</p><p>He and his fellow Twitter executives turned down an offer from <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> to purchase Twitter early on.</p><p>While working on dispatching as a programmer, Dorsey moved to California. In 2000, Dorsey started his company in Oakland to dispatch couriers, taxis, and emergency services from the Web. His other projects and ideas at this time included networks of medical devices and a “frictionless service market”. In July 2000, building on dispatching and inspired in part by LiveJournal and by AOL Instant Messenger, he had the idea for a Web-based realtime status/short message communication service.</p><p>When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey wondered whether the software’s user status output could be shared easily among friends. He approached Odeo, which at the time happened to be interested in text messaging. Dorsey and Biz Stone decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and built a prototype of Twitter in about two weeks. The idea attracted many users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams, a co-founder of that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and Blogger.</p><p align=justify>He grew up in St. Louis with his parents Marcia and Tim. He previously dated model and actress <a href=#>Lily Cole</a>.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jack Dorsey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dorsey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1976</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>St. Louis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Missouri</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marcia Dorsey, Tim Dorsey</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jack Dorsey ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In November, when Iranians took to the streets in the Green Revolution, Twitter was scheduled to conduct maintenance of its site, which would entail temporarily shutting down Twitter’s servers. Dorsey responded to a request from Cohen to delay the maintenance so that it would not affect the revolution in Iran, because Iranians were using Twitter to communicate and coordinate. Since President Obama had announced that there would be no meddling in Iran, the move sparked controversy.
