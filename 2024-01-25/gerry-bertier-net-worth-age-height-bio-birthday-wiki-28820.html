Football player best known for being a member in the 1971 Virginia State Champion T. C. Williams High School football team. The team was featured in The 2000 Disney movie Remember the Titans.&nbsp;Williams was later crippled from the waist in a vehicle accident. He then became a remarkable paralympian, winning gold medals for discus throw and shot put.</p><p>The character was played in the film by actor&nbsp;He was portrayed by actor <a href=#>Ryan Hurst</a> in Remember the Titans.&nbsp;in Remember the Titans.</p><p>On December 11, 1971, Bertier had been at a banquet honoring the players of the 1971 T.C. Williams Titans football team for their undefeated season. After the banquet, Bertier borrowed his mother’s new 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. Bertier lost control of the Camaro and crashed. It was later determined to be caused by a mechanical failure in the motor mount of the engine. He was moved to the operating room when he was stabilized. Although doctors tried to relieve pressure on his spine to help him regain some feeling, it was unsuccessful. Bertier coordinated with junior colleges in Alexandria to set up a “Walk for Mankind,” and he encouraged students, adults, company executives to donate. Bertier occasionally met with others who survived similar injuries, helping them with their rehabilitation. Outside of his hometown, he made speeches across the country for rights for the disabled. He addressed subjects such as making buildings accessible to disabled people. Bertier worked for Abbey Medical selling medical equipment to disabled people, a position which allowed him to attend wheelchair sporting events held nationally.</p><p>Bertier began his high school career at Hammond High School and joined the football team. He became a key player, soon becoming the backbone of the defense. As a sophomore, he was starting linebacker, a position for which he won many honors. However, he was only able to play three seasons, when Hammond H.S. was merged with two other Alexandria high schools to form T.C. Williams High School. The consolidation meant there were many new faces on the football team as well as on the coaching staff, which caused racial tension between team members. This new mixture of Titans was forced to come together as a single successful team, dealing with the issue of racial prejudice, a difficult battle for many members of the team. As a captain, Bertier, along with friend and teammate defensive end Julius Campbell, supported their teammates through this time of struggle. Even though the team was still struggling with prejudice as the season opener rolled around, the strife was not evident in the way the T.C. Titans began the 1971 season. The Titans went 13-0, including nine shut outs, and went on to win the Virginia State Championship. During the Titans’ undefeated season, they also outscored their opponents by a 357-45 margin. Bertier’s stats during the season included 142 tackles, 42 sacks. Bertier was named team Defensive Most Valuable Player. He was named National Prep School Football Player of the Year, and received First Team All-Region, All-State, and All-American honors. As he prepared to move to the next level, Bertier received many football scholarship offers from prominent colleges like Notre Dame and University of Alabama.</p><p align=justify>He was primarily raised through his maternal Jean.&nbsp;He had a sister called Becky Britt.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gerry Bertier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gerry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bertier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alexandria</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jean Agnew</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Gerry Bertier ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
