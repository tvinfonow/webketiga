The mask was made by Ukrainian design studio Bob Basset. This and the subsequent masks made by Basset are all made of leather and have a style reminiscent of his earlier gas masks. The music video for Slipknot’s single “The Devil in I” from their 2014 album .5: The Gray Chapter, features a mask with circular eye holes similar to those from his Iowa era mask, however these are covered by metal grills that resemble spatulas. The mask also has a removable metal plate that can be placed over the mouth, in which he has a sharp golden grill. Wilson’s mask was drastically changed once again for the release of Slipknot’s sixth album We Are Not Your Kind, becoming an animatronic death mask of his own face, covered partly by a large black hood and robe. This mask drew significant attention, though mostly positive, for being a drastic leap from the designs of any previous Slipknot masks and for being reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine or a slasher villain.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sid Wilson height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Sid <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After the death of bassist Paul Gray in 2010, and during the subsequent Memorial World Tour, Wilson, in keeping with the rest of the band, reverted to his old mask and red jump suit, worn during the self-titled album tour, as a tribute to Gray.</p><h2>Who is Sid Wilson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sid Wilson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
