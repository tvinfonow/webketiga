Who is Kevin Hines dating now & how much money does Kevin Hines have?</p><h2>Kevin Hines Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kevin Hines</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Self-Help Author</strong> who was born on <strong>August 30, 1981</strong> in United States, <strong>United States</strong>. Self-help author who has worked on the board of the International Bipolar Foundation, the Bridge Rail Foundation, and the Mental Health Association of San Francisco. He released the memoir Cracked Not Broken, Surviving and Thriving After A Suicide Attempt in 2013.</p><p>He and <a href=#>Ken Griffey Jr.</a> are both famous people that have survived suicide.</p><p>ABC News reported that Hines began hearing voices in his head telling him to die. On his walk up the pathway, he wept. Hines contemplated not jumping, reasoning that if any person showed that they cared about him, he would not commit suicide. A female police officer and bridge workers passed him without stopping. A woman with a German accent did come up to him and asked him to take her picture at the bridge, but she did not mention anything about his tears or ask about his well-being. After she left, he took several steps and threw himself over the rail. After leaping, Hines, as described by Time, had instant regret: “When my hands left that rail—and my legs curled over—as soon as I left the bridge, I thought, ‘I don’t want to die’.” He had gone over the railing head first, but when he regretted his decision, turned himself around to land in the water legs first. The impact force was comparable to slamming into a concrete wall. After he’d surfaced, he felt a creature nudging his body which he initially thought was a shark trying to eat him, and punched at it. The creature was later identified as a sea lion by a witness. The sea lion helped keep Hines afloat until he was rescued by the Coast Guard.</p><p>Hine’s mission, through his foundation, is to provide mental health education and suicide prevention information. The organization is run largely by his wife, Margaret, and a small team of leaders. Methods for achieving their mission include worldwide public speaking engagements, research initiatives, applicable education through wellness programs, and multi-media projects that focus on mental wellness for holistic health, including a YouTube Channel that focuses on mental health and a Documentary Film, Suicide: The Ripple Effect. The film was awarded Best Story at the Nice International Film Festival in Nice, France in 2018.</p><p align=justify>He married Margaret Hines. His parents are named Patrick and Debbie.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin Hines</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hines</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Self-Help Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Patrick Hines, Debbie Hines</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Margaret Hines</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin Hines ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kevin Hines</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He attempted suicide in 2000 by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and survived. He became one of 36 to survive as of 2017.</p><p align=justify>He appeared in a suicide prevention promotional campaign with <a href=#>Logan Paul</a> in January 2018. He has more than 50,000 followers on his kevinhinesstory Instagram account.</p><p align=justify>Hines was nine months old when he was adopted by Pat and Debbie Hines, who were both from the San Francisco area. At ten, he was put on Tegretol to help control epileptic seizures. The medicine worked well for him. He was athletic as a teen, becoming a football player and wrestler. At sixteen, he was taken off of the medicine because he’d had no more seizures. The Tegretol had unknowingly been suppressing characteristics of bipolar disorder, and combined outside stresses impacted him as well. Around that time, Pat left Debbie and Hines remained with her. Debbie said Hines changed drastically. Hines was also deeply affected by the suicide of his drama teacher. Manifestations of his depression included regular mood swings, paranoia, hallucinations and voices, as well as becoming harder to control. In January 2000, Hines moved in with Pat after a serious argument with Debbie. In September of that year, his girlfriend broke up with him. Over that weekend, he wrote and discarded a number of suicide notes, until the seventh one, which he was satisfied with. He told his father “I don’t want to be here any more”, and his father said “You have an obligation to be here. We love you.” On Monday, September 25, Pat was concerned about his son and offered to spend the day with him watching movies or bring him to his workplace. Hines declined, and hugged and kissed his father goodbye as he thought he’d never see him again, as Pat dropped him off at City College. Hines said he’d actually felt fine, because he was satisfied in knowing he was going to end his pain. He took a bus from City College to the Golden Gate bridge.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Self-Help Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Hines height</b> Not available right now.
