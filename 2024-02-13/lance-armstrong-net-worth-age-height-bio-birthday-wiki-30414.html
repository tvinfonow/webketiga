Seven-time Tour de France champion who was banned from cycling competitions for life by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in 2012.</p><p>He was the second Biker to win the 2002 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year; the first was the great <a href=#>Greg LeMond</a>.</p><p>Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson; September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist. He became regarded as a sports icon for his seven consecutive Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005, the most in the event’s history. However, Armstrong’s reputation would be tarnished by a doping scandal that led to him being disqualified of his titles.</p><p>Armstrong confirmed the story. On the main evening news on TF1, a national television station, Armstrong said, “His accusations aren’t good for cycling, for his team, for me, for anybody. If he thinks cycling works like that, he’s wrong and he would be better off going home”. Kimmage, a professional cyclist in the 1980s who later became a sports journalist, referred to Armstrong as a “cancer in cycling”. He also asked Armstrong questions in relation to his “admiration for dopers” at a press conference at the Tour of California in 2009, provoking a scathing reaction from Armstrong. This spat continued and is exemplified by Kimmage’s articles in The Irish Independent.</p><p align=justify>He had three kids with his first wife, Kristin Richards, who he divorced in 2003. That same year, he began dating singer <a href=#>Sheryl Crow</a>, who he broke up with in 2006, and later dated <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a> and <a href=#>Ashley Olsen</a>. He later began dating <a href=#>Anna Hansen</a> and the couple welcomed two children.
