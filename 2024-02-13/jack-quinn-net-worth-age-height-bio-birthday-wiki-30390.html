Quinn was born in Buffalo, New York on April 13, 1951. His father, Jack Quinn Sr., was a locomotive engineer with the South Buffalo Railway, and also worked at the Erie County Public Library. Quinn’s mother is Norma; and he has four brothers, Kevin, Jeffrey, Thomas, and Michael.</p><p>Quinn was a middle school English teacher in the Orchard Park Central School District for 10 years,where he coached track and field, basketball, and football. Prior to entering the teaching field, Quinn briefly worked at the Bethlehem Steel Plant in Lackawanna, New York. He served on the Hamburg, New York Town Council from 1982 to 1984, followed by a stint as town supervisor until 1993.</p><p>Regarding abortion, Quinn has stated that he is pro-life. In 1994, Democrat Ellen T. Kennedy criticized Quinn for voting against a bill that would make it a crime to block abortion clinic access.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jack Quinn</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>John Francis “Jack” Quinn Jr. (born April 13, 1951) was a former President of Erie Community College (ECC), and a former politician from the State of New York. He was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005. Quinn’s political views are Moderate-Conservative to Conservative, and his voting record reflects Centrist leanings. While in Congress, Quinn was active in numerous committees, subcommittees, and caucuses as chair or member. Prior to becoming a congressional representative, Quinn taught in Orchard Park, New York; worked at a steel plant; and was active in the Hamburg Town Council, as well as being the town’s supervisor. After leaving Congress and prior to taking the top leadership post at ECC, Quinn was also president of a lobbying firm in Washington, DC. Quinn has two adult children, including his son, former New York State Assembly Member Jack Quinn III; and his daughter, Kara Elizabeth. He currently resides in Hamburg with his wife, Mary Beth.</p><p align=justify>Quinn graduated from Siena College with a bachelor of arts degree in 1973 and the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1978 with a Master’s degree in Education. Quinn also holds a school superintendent credential that he earned at the State University of New York at Fredonia.</p><p align=justify>After the retirement of Congressman Henry Nowak, Quinn was elected to the House of Representatives in 1992 representing most of Buffalo and suburban Erie County in the 30th District. On paper, the district was heavily Democratic, and had been made even more Democratic after redistricting in 1992. However, Quinn defeated Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski in an upset. He was re-elected five more times by surprisingly wide margins in what was by far the most Democratic district in the nation to be represented by a Republican.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1998 at Canisius College in Buffalo, Quinn hosted fellow Congress Member John Lewis, a Democrat and African-American from Georgia who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights movement. The talk in which the two congressional leaders participated was regarding race relations and how they can be improved. The event was attending largely by African-Americans, and was suggested to be an attempt at increasing bloc voter support for Quinn among the Black community in Buffalo.</p><p>Regarding Medicare funding for hospitals in relation to “The Quinn-Lowey Hospital Emergency Assistance Act,” Quinn was quoted in a July 28, 1999 official press release, stating:</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jack Quinn height</b> <strong>6′ 0″</strong> Jack <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6′ 0″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It has been suggested that Quinn would have been better to be a Democrat in Buffalo, though as a Republican, he appeared to garner more Republican support in Congress than a Democrat would have. In reality, Quinn has been asked if he would become Democrat, and has not directly answered that question. At that time he was asked in 1996, he stated that there were more important issues at hand, such as balancing the budget, than to which political party one was affiliated.</p><p align=justify>Despite a close relationship with Bill Clinton, whom he considers his friend, he voted for three of the articles of impeachment against him. There have been several suggestions that the House leadership pressured him into doing so, though Quinn, himself, denied this in a 1999 article in the Washington Post. Quinn stated that his position in regard to impeaching Clinton was “a vote of conscience” that was “a personal decision and personally painful”, though he initially stated that the situation did not merit impeachment. It has been reported that Clinton’s 1999 visit to Buffalo after his State of the Union Address was in response to Quinn’s votes.</p><h2>Who is Jack Quinn Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jack Quinn</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
