Who is Brian France dating now & how much money does Brian France have?</p><h2>Brian France Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Brian France</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Businessman</strong> who was born on <strong>August 2, 1962</strong> in Daytona Beach, Florida, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>France managed several short tracks, including Tucson Raceway Park in Arizona in the earlier years of his career. In the 1990s, he ran NASCAR’s Los Angeles office and helped create associations between NASCAR and the entertainment industry. As a result, films began advertising at NASCAR events, and NASCAR drivers began to feature in various forms of media. In 1995, Brian France helped to create the Craftsman Truck Series. In 2000, he became NASCAR’s executive vice president.</p><p>France became NASCAR’s CEO and Chairman of the Board in 2003, after his father retired from the position. One of France’s first actions as CEO was to create a new safety rule that barred drivers from racing back to the start/finish line when under caution. After assuming control of NASCAR, France negotiated a title sponsorship from Sprint Nextel and introduced the Chase for the Sprint Cup over the transition period, receiving a $4.5 billion television contract for the initial ten race seasons, in addition to a later multibillion-dollar deal with NBC. France also made an effort to expand the audience base of NASCAR to minorities, and allowed Toyota vehicles to begin competing on the NASCAR circuit. During France’s tenure as CEO, NASCAR tv ratings peaked in the mid-2000s, but by 2014, they had dropped, accompanied by a 15% decrease in track attendance. The Sporting News named France one of the five most powerful sports executives in 2005, and, in 2006, Time magazine named him one of the “100 Most Influential of the Century.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=6.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brian France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shelley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Watts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Businessman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daytona Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bill France, Jr., Betty Jane France</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lesa France Kennedy</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amy France , Megan Garcia , Megan Garcia</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Luke France, Lauren France, Meadow France, Will France</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brian France ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
