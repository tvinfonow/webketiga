Who is Harrison Burton dating now & how much money does Harrison Burton have?</p><h2>Harrison Burton Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Harrison Burton</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Racing Driver</strong> who was born on <strong>October 9, 2000</strong> in Huntersville, Huntersville, <strong>United States</strong>. Harrison Brian Burton (born October 9, 2000) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 20 Toyota Supra for Joe Gibbs Racing, and part-time in the ARCA Menards Series, driving the No. 20 Toyota Camry for Venturini Motorsports.</p><p>The Charlotte, North Carolina native made his CARS debut in 2015, running six of the series’ ten races. Finishing only two of those races, he finished third at Southern National Motorsports Park and fourth at Concord Speedway. In the middle of that season, the team switched car bodies and crew chiefs, hiring former Xfinity Series driver Chris Wimmer. Switching his focus to the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East, he only ran three of eight races in 2016, recording two top ten finishes.</p><p>Starting with the 2016 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East season opener at New Smyrna, Burton became the youngest driver to start a race in the series. He also garnered a full-time ride from HScott Motorsports using their Toyotas. Throughout the thirteen race season, Burton garnered one pole, as many top fives, and finished eighth in the championship point standings while failing to finish two races. After HScott Motorsports with Justin Marks shut down, Burton moved to MDM Motorsports bringing his number and sponsor. He also signed an extension with Kevin Harvick Incorporated to bring in sponsors like DEX Imaging, Hunt Brothers Pizza, Rheem and others. Early in the season, Burton made waves by campaigning a paint scheme with the number on the rear quarter panels. His performance also gained attention, winning a rain-shortened race at Bristol. He then outlasted the field at Memphis the following race after Todd Gilliland had a flat tire. He went on to win five of fourteen races that season and beat Gilliland for the championship after making up an eight-point deficit going into the final race.</p><p>In his ARCA Racing Series debut for Ranier Racing with MDM, Burton started sixth and finished third after almost being spun out by eventual race winner Chase Briscoe. Returning in 2017 with MDM Motorsports, Burton chased down Dalton Sargeant on the final run of the race at Toledo Speedway to win in only his second series start. He later won in his superspeedway debut, which came at Pocono Raceway in 2018. Burton dedicated the win to John Andretti, who was battling colon cancer until his death in 2020.</p><p align=justify>Burton’s racing career started off when he received a go-kart at age two, which later turned in to a quarter midget at age four. After starting to race them at age twelve, Burton won his first late model race in early 2014. His first super late model win came in early 2015, at New Smyrna Speedway. He was also for three years a USAC quarter midget championship. At age 11, he grabbed his first late model pole at Ace Speedway, and at twelve won two races in pro late models.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harrison Burton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harrison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harrison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Racing Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>2000</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Huntersville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Huntersville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeff Burton, Kim Burton</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paige Burton</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Harrison Burton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
