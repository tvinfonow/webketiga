He claimed the death was accidental and the result of rough sex, and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the end of his trial.</p><p>Jennifer Levin’s half-naked corpse, covered in dust, and bite marks, was found by a cyclist in Central Park near Fifth Avenue and 83rd Street, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Clothing from Levin’s upper body had been pushed up around her neck, and her skirt was around her waist. The medical examiner’s office determined she had been strangled. Police noted there were numerous cuts and bruises on her neck, both from the strangulation and from her own fingernails as she clawed at her killer’s hands. Later, Chambers hid and watched as police officers surveyed the scene. Investigators found Levin’s underwear some 50 yards (46&nbsp;m) away.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert Chambers</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Love</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Phyllis Chambers, Robert Chambers, Sr.</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Robert Chambers ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
