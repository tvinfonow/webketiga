Enjoying initial success in the first few days, Hantz grew frustrated of the laid-back mentality from his fellow tribe-mates and began actively searching for, and locating, a Hidden Immunity Idol. Wanting to cause paranoia, Hantz announced his intention to play the hidden immunity idol at their first Tribal Council. During this time he formed allegiances with Samuel Hinton, Monika Radulovic and Damien Thomlinson. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Hantz attempted to orchestrate a split vote between Jackie Glazier and Shane Gould but a counter-alliance led by Moana Hope forced a tie in the event Hantz’ hidden immunity idol was played. At Tribal Council, Hantz did not play his hidden immunity idol leading to a revote between himself and Glazier. At the revote, Thomlinson stayed loyal to Hantz with the rest of the vote eliminating him in a unanimous decision. He finished in 23rd place.</p><p>Russell Hantz (born October 10, 1972) is an American oilfield service company owner and television personality, best known for his appearances on the U.S. reality show, Survivor.

As a promotion for Redemption Island, Hantz appeared on the cover of TV Guide Magazine for the week of February 14, 2011, alongside Rob Mariano.</p><h2>Russell Hantz Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Russell Hantz is one of the <strong>richest Reality Star</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Russell Hantz</b>'s net worth <strong>$2 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Original application for the CBS series Pirate Master was rejected due to low ratings.</p><p align=justify>He was a popular contestant on Survivor: Samoa and Surviver: Heroes and Villians. On both seasons, he was voted “Sprint player of the Season” and was awarded $100,000.</p><p align=justify>Hantz returned for Survivor: Redemption Island, the show’s 22nd season, to face off with his old rival, “Boston Rob.” By a random draw, Hantz joined the Zapatera tribe, which later threw the third immunity challenge and immediately targeted him and his ally, Stephanie Valencia. Suspecting that something was up, Hantz devised a counter-strategy, but was ultimately voted out at the next Tribal Council and sent to Redemption Island. His elimination from the game was finalized upon losing the Redemption Island duel to Matt Elrod. Deeply saddened by the loss, Hantz stated that this season would be his last on Survivor, although at the reunion show he indirectly stated that he had changed his mind.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reality Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hantz’s performance on Survivor was initially met with a mixed reception. Many consider him to be one of the show’s greatest and most influential contestants, while others have strongly criticized his strategy, naming him one of the biggest villains in Survivor history. Nevertheless, Hantz was voted “Sprint Player of the Season” by which he was awarded a $100,000 cash prize on both Survivor: Samoa and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. He was also one of the first five contestants inducted into the “Survivor Hall of Fame” in 2010, alongside Richard Hatch, Rob Mariano, Parvati Shallow, and Sandra Diaz-Twine. Additionally, he is one of only eight contestants to ever make it to the finals in more than one season, in addition to Mariano, Amanda Kimmel, Shallow, Diaz-Twine, Tony Vlachos, Natalie Anderson, and Michele Fitzgerald. Hantz was nominated in the 2010 Teen Choice Awards for his performance on Heroes vs. Villains.</p><p>In 2011, Hantz was accused of violating his Survivor contract by leaking information regarding the show’s results. Late in the previous year, a man named Jim Early was sued by executive producer and Survivor creator Mark Burnett’s DJB Inc., for successfully spoiling Survivor: Samoa and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains on a Survivor fansite known as Survivor Sucks. The lawsuit accused Early of “misappropriation of trade secrets” and “tortious interference with contract.” The charges were dropped on January 13, 2011, after Early provided to an attorney an email, which allegedly confirmed Hantz as source of the spoilers. Early claims that he had originally made contact with Hantz via telephone to warn him that someone had posted his private information online, but that Hantz had recontacted him later and begun revealing accurate information about the show’s outcome, which Early posted to the fansite. Thus far, no legal action has been taken against Hantz, although contestants who reveal information regarding a season’s results may face liquidated damages of $5 million. In an interview with USA today, Hantz denied the accusations, commenting, “See, that’s another thing. I am the villain, and its unfair that people perceive me that way, and they throw out things that’s not fair to me or my family, and I guess I got to deal with it. I’m not sure if I’m supposed to comment on this or not, but it is 100% false.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Russell Hantz height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Russell <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On April 23, 2010, at 2:15 am, Hantz was arrested for battery while partying near the bar he owns in Lafayette, Louisiana. A woman was involved in a verbal argument with Hantz, during which he allegedly shoved her to the ground, causing her minor injuries. Hantz was released later that day without bail but was given a misdemeanor summons and a court date scheduled for June 24.</p><p align=justify>At the final immunity challenge, Hantz edged out Shallow and Manthey by a few inches. He then chose to vote out Manthey, assuming he would get her vote for the Survivor title. His game, however, was panned by the jurors, all of whom refused to vote for Hantz in the end. Diaz-Twine ultimately triumphed over him and Shallow in a 6–3–0 vote, thus winning her second Sole Survivor title. Despite his shutout loss, Hantz’s Reunion experience was similar to his last one in that he won the “Sprint Player of the Season” award and $100,000 for the second time.</p><h2>Who is Russell Hantz Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Russell Hantz</strong> married to <strong>Melanie Hantz </strong>.
