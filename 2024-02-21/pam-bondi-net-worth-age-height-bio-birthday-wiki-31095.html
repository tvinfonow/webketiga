Who is Pam Bondi dating now & how much money does Pam Bondi have?</p><h2>Pam Bondi Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Pam Bondi</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Lawyer</strong> who was born on <strong>November 17, 1965</strong> in Tampa, Florida, <strong>United States</strong>. Pamela Jo Bondi (born November 17th 1965) is a famous American lawyer, lobbyist and politician.&nbsp;A Republican She was the 37th Florida Attorney General from 2011 until 2019.</p><p>Bondi’s ties to Scientology and the many fundraising events which wealthy Scientologists have put together to help Bondi’s political campaign over the years have also caused controversy.&nbsp;Bondi has justified her connections and her appearances before the Scientologists she has admired by saying that Scientology is trying to aid her in cracking down against human trafficking.&nbsp;However , her public ties to Scientology started in 2010, after it was already probed by the FBI for its involvement in human trafficking and abuse of its employees.</p><p>Bondi was criticized for some of her election fundraising activities, including contributions received from Donald Trump and his associates. The Florida Attorney General’s office received at least 22 fraud complaints about Trump University. In 2013, a spokesperson for Bondi announced that her office was considering joining a lawsuit initiated by New York’s Attorney General against Trump regarding tax fraud. Four days later, ‘And Justice for All’, a political action committee (PAC) established by Bondi to support her re-election campaign, received a $25,000 donation from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, after which Bondi declined to join the lawsuit against Trump University. When controversy over their actions first arose in 2013, both the Bondi PAC and Donald Trump defended the propriety of the nonprofit foundation’s political donation.</p><p>In 2013, Bondi persuaded Governor Rick Scott to postpone a scheduled execution because it conflicted with her reelection kickoff/fundraising event. After questions were raised in the media, Bondi apologized for moving the execution date.</p><p align=justify>Bondi prosecuted the former Major League Baseball player Dwight Gooden in 2006 for violating terms of his probation as well as for the use of drugs.&nbsp;In 2007 Bondi also prosecuted defendants in the death of Martin Anderson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pam Bondi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bondi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tampa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joseph Bondi, Pasty Bondi</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Beth Bondi McIntyre, Brad Bondi</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Scott Fitzgerald , Garret Barnes</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Pam Bondi ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It said that the Foundation had intended for the donation to go not to Bondi’s PAC but instead to an unrelated Kansas non-profit called Justice for All. However, in June 2016, as Bondi was facing renewed criticism over the Trump donation and her decision not to join the lawsuit, her spokesman said that Bondi had solicited the donation directly from Trump several weeks before her office announced it was considering joining the lawsuit against him. Bondi and Trump did not reconcile their competing versions of events. On March 14, 2016, Bondi endorsed Trump in the Florida presidential primary, saying she has been friends with Trump “for many years.” In June 2016, a spokesperson for Governor Rick Scott stated that the state’s ethics commission is looking into the matter. Nothing further came from that investigation. In September 2016, the IRS determined that the donation to Bondi’s PAC violated laws against political contributions from nonprofit organizations, and ordered Trump to pay a fine for the illegal contribution. Trump also was required to reimburse the foundation for the sum that had been donated to Bondi. Neither Bondi nor her PAC were fined or criminally charged for soliciting and accepting an illegal donation. In November 2019, Trump was ordered by a New York state court to close down the foundation and pay $2 million in damages for misusing it, including the illegal payment to Bondi.</p><h2>Pam Bondi Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Pam Bondi is one of the <strong>richest Lawyer</strong> from United States.

Bondi in a radio interview stated that the CNN interview had not been aired in its entirety and most of it was left on the cutting room floor, omitting the portion about potential scamming of survivors’ families. While the entire interview had been aired live, only the portion involving Bondi’s position on LGBT issues was originally uploaded to the CNN website. The website featured the interview in its entirety following this comment. In 2017, she opposed O.J.

Fox News claimed that the Florida Commission on Ethics had approved Bondi’s appearance on the program; however the commission’s spokeswoman denied that, telling the Tampa Bay Times that “no opinion was rendered” and that the commission’s general counsel “did not express a view as to whether [Bondi’s proposed hosting of the Fox shows] would or would not violate the Code of Ethics”. The Tampa Bay Times described it as “unprecedented” for a sitting elected official to host a TV show.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Pam Bondi height</b> Not available right now.
