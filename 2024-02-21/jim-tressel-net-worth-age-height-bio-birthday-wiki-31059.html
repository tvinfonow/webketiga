In Tressel’s first season as coach, Youngstown State finished with a 2–9 record. In his second season, Youngstown State finished the season with an 8–4 record and won the Ohio Valley Conference championship. From 1991–1994, Youngstown State would play in the Division I-AA National Championship game four times. In 1991, Tressel won his first national championship, defeating Marshall; the victory made him and his father the only father-son duo to win national championships in college football at that time (Vince and Larry Kehres have also won national championships).</p><h2>Jim Tressel Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jim Tressel is one of the <strong>richest Football Coach</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jim Tressel</b>'s net worth <strong>$18 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He made friends along with&nbsp;He became friends with <a href=#>Lou Groza</a>, and the two practiced football together., and the two played football together.</p><p align=justify>He was director of the team at Youngstown State from 1986 to 2000.</p><p align=justify>Tressel was born on December 5, 1952 in Mentor, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. His father, Lee Tressel, was the coach at Mentor’s high school. After a 34-game winning streak at Mentor, Lee was hired as head football coach for Baldwin–Wallace College in Berea, Ohio. Baldwin–Wallace won the 1978 NCAA Division III National Championship under Tressel’s father. Tressel attended many of his father’s games and practices, and developed a friendship with neighbor (and former Cleveland Browns player) Lou Groza. Tressel’s mother Eloise Tressel worked as the athletic historian at Baldwin–Wallace while his father was the head coach.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$18 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Youngstown State won two more national championships in the following three years: against Marshall in 1993 (who had defeated them in 1992) and Boise State in 1994. 1997 brought Tressel his fourth national championship with a 10–9 victory against McNeese State. He earned his 100th win against Indiana State. 1999 marked Tressel’s ninth visit to the Division I-AA playoffs, but the team lost to a Paul Johnson coached Georgia Southern in the title game. 2000 presented Tressel with more success, leading Youngstown State to a 9–3 season and its 10th playoff appearance. During the 1990s, Youngstown State had a record of 103–27–2, the most wins by any Division I-AA team and fourth most of both Division I-A and I-AA combined. Tressel’s overall record at Youngstown was 135–57–2. He was also named Division I-AA Coach of the Year in ’91, ’93, ’94, and ’97.</p><p>In 1998, Tressel’s reputation was blemished when it emerged that Ray Isaac, quarterback on his first national championship team, admitted to accepting massive benefits from Mickey Monus, the founder of Phar-Mor and former chairman of the Youngstown State board of trustees. The NCAA had been tipped off about the violations in 1994, but dropped its inquiry after a cursory internal investigation by Youngstown State. The nature of the violations only came to light when Isaac admitted to tampering with a juror in Monus’ first corporate fraud trial. It later emerged that Tressel had never met with Isaac during the initial 1994 investigation. Monus subsequently testified that when Isaac initially came to Youngstown State in 1988, Tressel called Monus and asked him to work out a job for Isaac. Youngstown State subsequently admitted to a lack of institutional control and docked itself scholarships. The NCAA ultimately faulted Tressel and Youngstown State for their cursory 1994 investigation, but did not cite them for wrongdoing. Youngstown State was also allowed to keep its 1991 title since the NCAA’s statute of limitations had run out.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jim Tressel height</b> Not available right now.

He coached the quarterbacks, receivers, and running backs, while earning a master’s degree in education. In 1978, he left to become quarterbacks and receivers coach at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. By 1981, he had left to become the quarterbacks coach at Syracuse. In 1983, he was hired at Ohio State to be the quarterbacks and receivers coach. That year, OSU had a 9–3 record, including a 28–23 victory over Pittsburgh in the Fiesta Bowl; a 39-yard pass from quarterback Mike Tomczak to wide receiver Thad Jemison clinched the win with 39 seconds remaining in the game. In 1984, he was given the added responsibility of coaching the running backs. That year, the team became Big Ten champs, played in the Rose Bowl, and tailback Keith Byars finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting. In 1985, OSU defeated BYU in the Citrus Bowl.</p><p align=justify>When John Cooper was dismissed as Ohio State’s head football coach following a loss to unranked South Carolina in the 2001 Outback Bowl, Tressel returned to Ohio State and became Cooper’s successor. While addressing the Ohio State community during halftime of a basketball game just after being hired as head coach, Tressel declared, “I can assure you that you will be proud of your young people in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the football field.”</p><h2>Who is Jim Tressel Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jim Tressel</strong> married to <strong>Ellen Tressel </strong>.
