Who is Jennifer Connelly dating now & how much money does Jennifer Connelly have?</p><h2>Jennifer Connelly Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Movie Actress</strong> who was born on <strong>December 12, 1970</strong> in Cairo, New York State, <strong>United States</strong>. Award-winning actress known for her role in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, which won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her performances in Blood Diamond, Requiem for a Dream and House of Sand and Fog also helped her gain critical acclaim. In 2019, she was cast in Top Gun: Maverick.</p><p>She starred in Requiem For a Dream with <a href=#>Jared Leto</a>.</p><p>Jennifer Lynn Connelly (born December 12, 1970) is an American actress who began her career as a child model. She appeared in magazine, newspaper and television advertising, before she made her film acting debut in the crime film Once Upon a Time in America (1984). Connelly continued modeling and acting, starring in a number of films, including the horror film Phenomena (1985), the musical fantasy film Labyrinth (1986), the romantic comedy Career Opportunities (1991), and the period superhero film The Rocketeer (1991). She gained critical acclaim for her work in the science fiction film Dark City (1998) and for playing a drug addict in Darren Aronofsky’s drama Requiem for a Dream (2000).</p><p>When her mother began taking her to acting auditions, a then 12-year-old Connelly was quickly selected for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone’s Jewish gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America (filmed 1982-83, released 1984). The role required her to perform a ballet routine. During the audition, Connelly, who had no ballet training, tried to imitate a ballerina. Her performance, and the similarity of her nose to Elizabeth McGovern’s, who played the character as an adult, convinced the director to cast her. Connelly described the movie as “an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie-making”. While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed, Connelly made her first television appearance, in the episode “Stranger in Town” of the British series Tales of the Unexpected.</p><p align=justify>She married <a href=#>Paul Bettany</a> in January 2003; they have children named Stellan and Agnes. She also had a son named Kai from a previous relationship with photographer David Dugan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jennifer Connelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jennifer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cairo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gerard Connelly, Eileen Connelly</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paul Bettany</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kai Dugan, Stellan Bettany, Agnes Lark Bettany</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jennifer Connelly ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Although a disappointment at the box office, the film later became a cult classic. The New York Times, while noting the importance of her part, panned her portrayal: “Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing. … She looks right, but she lacks conviction and seems to be reading rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it.” In 1988, she began work as a ballet student in the Italian film Etoile which was released in 1989, and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman’s Some Girls.</p><h2>Jennifer Connelly Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jennifer Connelly is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actress</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jennifer Connelly</b>'s net worth <strong>$50 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She began her career as a child model with the Ford Modeling Agency.

She is the daughter of Ilene, an antiques dealer, and Gerard Karl Connelly (1941–2008), a clothing manufacturer. Her father was Roman Catholic, and of Irish and Norwegian descent. Connelly’s mother was Jewish, and was educated at a yeshiva; all of Connelly’s maternal great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Poland and Russia. Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights, near the Brooklyn Bridge, where she attended Saint Ann’s, a private school specializing in the arts. Her father suffered from asthma, so the family moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1976 to escape the city smog. Four years later, the family returned to Brooklyn Heights, and Connelly returned to Saint Ann’s School.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When Connelly was ten years old, an advertising executive friend of her father suggested she audition as a model. Her parents sent a picture of her to the Ford Modeling Agency, which shortly after added her to its roster. Connelly began modeling for print advertisements before moving on to television commercials. In an interview with The Guardian, she revealed that, after having done some modeling, she had no aspirations to become an actress. She appeared on the covers of several issues of Seventeen in 1986 and 1988. In December 1986, she recorded two pop songs for the Japanese market: “Monologue of Love” and “Message of Love”. She sang in phonetic Japanese as she did not speak the language.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Connelly went to Yale University in 1988 to study English literature. Connelly describes herself as a studious student who “wasn’t really concerned with having a social life or sleeping or eating much. I was really nerdy and pretty much stayed in the law-school library, which is open 24 hours, most of the time I wasn’t in class”. After two years at Yale, Connelly transferred to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama. There, she trained with Roy London, Howard Fine and Harold Guskin. Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career, Connelly left college and returned to the movie industry the same year.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jennifer Connelly height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Jennifer <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Connelly’s first leading role was in Italian giallo-director Dario Argento’s 1985 film Phenomena. In the film, she plays a girl who psychically communicates with insects to pursue the killer of students of the Swiss school where she has enrolled. Connelly next had the lead in the coming-of-age movie Seven Minutes in Heaven, released the same year.</p><p align=justify>The big-budget Disney film The Rocketeer (1991) followed later that year, but failed to ignite her career. She played Jenny Blake, a Disney dilution of what was in the original work a Betty Page persona, here the aspiring actress girlfriend of stunt pilot Cliff, “the Rocketeer”. New York characterized the movie as “pallid” and said of her performance, “Connelly is properly cast; she has the moist, full-to-the-cheek bones sensuality of the Hollywood starlets of that period, but she’s a little straight”. She appeared alongside Jason Priestley in the Roy Orbison music video for “I Drove All Night” the following year, directed by Peter Care.</p><h2>Who is Jennifer Connelly Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong> married to <strong>Paul Bettany </strong>.
