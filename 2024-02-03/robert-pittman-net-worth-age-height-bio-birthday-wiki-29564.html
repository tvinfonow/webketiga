In this role, Pittman worked to leverage the Company’s media assets and spearhead the further development of a digital strategy for Clear Channel Radio, particularly with regard to its iHeartRadio digital radio platform. At this time, the company was burdened with $20 billion in debt as the result of a 2008 leveraged buyout. In September 2014, the company transformed to iHeartMedia, Inc. to better reflect the company’s multi-platform focus. Today Pittman is Chairman and CEO of iHeartMedia, Inc., with multi-platform assets across broadcast radio; digital; podcasting; mobile; social; outdoor; data; and live events. Under Pittman’s leadership the company’s debt was significantly reduced — from $16.1 billion to $5.75 billion — and the company emerged from restructuring in May 2019. At that time, T. Rowe Price referenced the company as one that had been revived by disruptive change. iHeartMedia, Inc. is now the No. 1 commercial podcast publisher globally, and in October 2018 closed its acquisition of podcasting pioneer Stuff Media, LLC, the leading for-profit publisher of entertaining and informative podcast content, which includes the HowStuffWorks (HSW) brand and content. Pittman played a pivotal role in developing the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the biggest live concert festival in radio history, the first of which took place in Las Vegas on September 23–24, 2011 in conjunction with the launch of the New iHeartRadio. The company has since expanded its national tentpole live events platform to include the nationally televised iHeartRadio Music Awards; the iHeartRadio Country Festival; iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina; the iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party; and the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour. In December 2016, the company launched its two new on demand subscription platforms, iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Robert Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Entrepreneur</strong>.
