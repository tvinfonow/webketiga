Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Zakir Naik's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Zakir Naik's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Naik says that his goal is to “concentrate on the educated Muslim youth who have become apologetic about their own religion and have started to feel the religion is outdated”. He considers it a duty of every Muslim to remove perceived misconceptions about Islam and to counter what he views as the Western media’s anti-Islamic bias in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. Naik has said that “despite the strident anti-Islam campaign, 34,000 Americans have embraced Islam from September 2001 to July 2002”. According to Naik, Islam is a religion of reason and logic, and the Quran contains 1000 verses relating to science, which he says explains the number of Western converts. Some of his articles are published in magazines such as Islamic Voice.</p><h2>Zakir Naik Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Zakir Naik is one of the <strong>richest Doctor</strong> from India. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Zakir Naik</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He received his Bachelor of Surgery and Medicine from the University of Mumbai.</p><p align=justify>Some of his extreme views, like advocating the death penalty against homosexuals, have drawn heavy criticism.</p><p align=justify>Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen described Naik as “dangerous” because he “promotes 7th century Quranic texts on sex slaves, polygamy and wife beating in 21st century”. She said in a series of tweets that, “I listened to Zakir Naik’s speeches. He cites Quranic texts and tries to justify. He’s dangerous because it’s dangerous to spread 7th century texts in the 21st century”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2004 Naik, at the invitation of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, made an appearance at the University of Melbourne, where he argued that only Islam gave women true equality. He said the more “revealing Western dress” makes women more susceptible to rape. Sushi Das of The Age commented that “Naik extolled the moral and spiritual superiority of Islam and lampooned other faiths and the West in general”, further stating that Naik’s words “fostered a spirit of separateness and reinforced prejudice”.</p><p>In The Wall Street Journal, Sadanand Dhume criticised Naik for recommending the death penalty for homosexuals and for apostasy from the faith. He also criticised him for calling for India to be ruled by Shariah law. He added that, according to Naik, Jews “control America” and are the “strongest in enmity to Muslims.” He maintained that Naik supports a ban on the construction of non-Muslim places of worship in Muslim lands as well as the Taliban’s bombing of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Dhume argues that people reportedly drawn to Naik’s message include Najibullah Zazi, the Afghan-American arrested for planning suicide attacks on the New York subway; Rahil Sheikh, accused of involvement in a series of train bombings in Mumbai in 2006; and Kafeel Ahmed, the Bangalore man fatally injured in a failed suicide attack on Glasgow airport in 2007. He also stated that “unless Indians find the ability to criticise such a radical Islamic preacher as robustly as they would a Hindu equivalent, the ideal of Indian secularism would remain deeply flawed.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Zakir Naik height</b> Not available right now.

Naik has held many debates and lectures and is said to “have delivered over 2000/4000 lectures around the world”. Anthropologist Thomas Blom Hansen has written that Naik’s style of memorising the Quran and Hadith literature in various languages, and his related missionary activity, has made him extremely popular in Muslim circles. Many of his debates are recorded and widely distributed in video and DVD media and online. His talks have been recorded in English and broadcast on weekends on several cable networks in Mumbai’s Muslim neighbourhoods, and on the Peace TV channel, which he co-produces. Topics he speaks on include: “Islam and Modern Science”, “Islam and Christianity”, and “Islam and secularism”.</p><p align=justify>His first debate was in 1994, a debate on the views of writer Taslima Nasreen on Islam in her book Lajja, organised at the “Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh”, entitled “Is Religious Fundamentalism a Stumbling block to Freedom of Expression?”. With the presence of four journalists, the debate went on for hours. In April 2000, Naik debated with William Campbell in Chicago on the topic of “The Qur’an and the Bible: In the Light of Science”, one of his most-cited debates. On 21 January 2006 Naik held an inter-religious dialogue with Ravi Shankar in Bangalore about the concept of God in Islam and Hinduism. In February 2011 Naik addressed the Oxford Union via video link from India. Every year since November 2007 Naik has led a 10-day Peace Conference at Somaiya Ground, Sion, Mumbai. Lectures on Islam have been presented by Naik and twenty other Islamic speakers.</p><h2>Who is Zakir Naik Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Zakir Naik</strong> married to <strong>Farhat Naik</strong>.
