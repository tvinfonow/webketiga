A Russian-language comic, who was a very popular performer in the 1980s.&nbsp;His comic portrayal of a Soviet Union immigrant as a joker and comedian served to mock American consumerism and also serve to amuse.</p><p>He immigrated to America via the USSR.&nbsp;He emigrated to America from the USSR; <a href=#>Sophie Tucker</a> was another Ukraine-born comedienne.&nbsp;was also a Ukrainian-born comedian.</p><p>Smirnoff began doing stand-up comedy in the US in the late 1970s.

He was an art teacher in Odessa, as well as a comedian. As a comedian, he entertained occasionally on ships in the Black Sea, where he came into contact with Americans who described life in the United States to him. That was when he first considered leaving the country. After two years of attempting to leave, he came to the United States with his parents in 1977, arriving in New York City. His family was allowed to come to America because of an agreement between the USSR and America to exchange wheat for Soviet citizens who wished to defect. At the time, neither he nor his parents spoke any English. On arrival to the United States, he was almost sent back to Russia when his translator mistranslated his occupation, comedian, as “party organizer”, which immigration authorities thought meant that he was an organizer for the Communist Party.</p><p align=justify>Before he and Linda divorced in 1999, he had two children together.&nbsp;In 1986, he became an American citizen.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yakov Smirnoff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yakov</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Smirnoff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Comedian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Odessa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ukraine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda Dreeszen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Alexander Pokhis, Natasha Pokhis</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Yakov Smirnoff ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
