The decision was controversial because some who felt that Hunt’s weight of 280&nbsp;lb (125&nbsp;kg), over 80&nbsp;lb more than Silva, as well as Silva’s performance in rounds two and three, had not been sufficiently considered by the judges in their decision; Randy Couture and Bas Rutten, both being commentators at the event, expressed disagreement with the judges decision.
