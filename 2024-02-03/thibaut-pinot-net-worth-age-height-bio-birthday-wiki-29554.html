Who is Thibaut Pinot dating now & how much money does Thibaut Pinot have?</p><h2>Thibaut Pinot Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Thibaut Pinot</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Cyclist</strong> who was born on <strong>May 29, 1990</strong> in Mélisey, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, <strong>France</strong>.</p><p>Pinot recovered and trained in order to ride his third Vuelta a España. As he finished 3rd overall at Tour de Pologne he was regarded as one of the main favorites at the Vuelta. However Pinot already lost time on stage 6 due to a combination of crosswinds and crashes which saw both him and Wilco Kelderman lose time. On a hilly stage 11, Pinot went into the breakaway, and was in the virtual leaders jersey at some point in the stage. On the last climb the peloton rode at a high pace, and Pinot only 12 seconds on the general classification contenders. On stage 14, Pinot almost managed to follow some of the main favorites to the finish line just losing 5 seconds to stage winner Simon Yates. On the following stage, Pinot could once again celebrate as he won stage 15 to the Lakes of Covadonga. He attacked with just under 6 kilometers to go, and was 28 seconds clear of 2nd place Miguel Ángel López. This meant Pinot had won stages in all three of the Grand Tours.</p><p>Pinot, aged 22 was the youngest rider in the 2012 Tour de France. He took a prestigious victory on the eighth stage from Belfort to Porrentruy, which comprised seven categorized climbs including the Category 1 Col de la Croix, where he passed Fredrik Kessiakoff (Astana) shortly before the summit. He then negotiated the descent and the flat portion of road before the finish situated 16&nbsp;km from the climb. He held on to his lead over the chasing group which included some of the Tour’s general classification contenders despite the head wind, being frantically encouraged by his team manager, Marc Madiot. He crossed the line alone with an advantage of 26 seconds over the chasers. Despite being the youngest rider of the Tour, he managed to finish 10th overall in the final general classification. At 22 years and 54 days, he became the youngest rider to finish in the top 10 since Raymond Impanis in 1947, who was then 21 years and 8 months old.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thibaut Pinot</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tiffany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rowe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cyclist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1990</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mélisey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bourgogne-Franche-Comté</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>France</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Régis Pinot, Marie-Jeanne Pinot</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Julien Pinot, Marine Pinot</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Thibaut Pinot ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

As it was the 100th edition of the Tour de France, Pinot had a lot of pressure put on him before the race as the only french general classification hope. However when the race hit the mountains, Pinot was struggling and the general classification was already out of sight after Stage 9. In the second week of the race, Pinot had problems with a sore throat and also admitted he was struggling on the descents, having a fear of speed. He abandoned the 2013 Tour de France on stage 16. Pinot was looking to redeem himself in the Vuelta a España, and got better throughout the race. On the pen-ultimate stage, Pinot climbed up to 7th place on the Angliru, which was also his finishing position in Madrid.</p><h2>Thibaut Pinot Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Thibaut Pinot is one of the <strong>richest Cyclist</strong> from France.

He and Péraud became the first Frenchmen to finish in the top three overall in the Tour de France since Richard Virenque finished as the runner-up overall in 1997. It was the first time in 30 years that two Frenchmen finished in the top three overall in the Tour de France – Laurent Fignon (winner) and Bernard Hinault (runner-up) finished in the top two overall in 1984.</p><p>Pinot was never on top of his game at the Tour de France and his best stage finish was 9th on stage 15, before abandoning the race on stage 17.

On October 10, Pinot won the 99th edition of the Milano–Torino, which was his second one-day race victory in his career. Three days later, Pinot would win again, as he claimed the biggest non-Grand Tour win of his career and his first ever Monument at Il Lombardia. Pinot rode with a high tempo starting from the Civiglio climb 15 kilometers from the finish line and the other three riders in the lead group at that time (Egan Bernal, Vincenzo Nibali and Primož Roglič) lost ground to him.

At the Tour de France however, Pinot lost a little over three minutes to other general classification contenders on stage 7 to Lac de Payolle. Pinot simply said it was his bad legs, as he was seen struggling on the final climb Col d’Aspin. On the following stage, Pinot rebounded and went into the breakaway. He and Rafal Majka was battling it out for points for the mountains jersey, with Majka taking the lead in the competition with just one point after the stage. His general classification was definitely over after the stage having lost 16 minutes to stage winner Chris Froome. On stage 9 he was yet again in the breakaway with Rafal Majka. This time Pinot managed to edge out the polish rider to wear the polka dot jersey on stage 10.
