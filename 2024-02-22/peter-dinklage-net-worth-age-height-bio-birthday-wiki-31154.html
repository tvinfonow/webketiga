The film tells the story of a director, crew, and cast filming a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. Dinklage’s role was that of a frustrated actor with dwarfism who complains about his clichéd roles. The film has been well received by critics. The following year he appeared as a building manager in the crime drama Bullet starring rapper Tupac Shakur. Even after his well-received performance in Living in Oblivion, Dinklage still could not find someone willing to be his agent. After a recommendation from Buscemi to the director Alexandre Rockwell, Dinklage was cast in the comedy 13 Moons (2002). When later interviewed for a theater website, he was asked what his ideal role was, and he replied “the romantic lead” who gets the girl.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Peter Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Actor</strong>.
