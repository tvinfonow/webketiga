He worked for National Geographic from 1992–1995, visiting Chad, Sudan, Senegal, Niger, Mali, and Nigeria.

The transcontinental foot journey will cover more than 21,000&nbsp;miles, beginning in Africa, in Ethiopia, across the Middle East and through Asia, via Alaska and down the western edge of the Americas to the southern tip of Chile. The project, entitled Out of Eden Walk, is funded by National Geographic Magazine, the Knight Foundation and the Abundance Foundation. The project is designed as a laboratory of slow journalism that engages with the major stories of our time—from climate change to technological innovation, from mass migration to cultural survival—by walking alongside the populations who inhabit such headlines every day. The object is to immerse readers in the lives of people encountered en route: the nomads, villagers, traders, farmers, and fishermen who rarely make the news. When the seven-year trek ends, the walk will have generated a global mosaic of stories, faces, sounds, and landscapes highlighting the pathways that connect us to each other—a mostly digital archive of our shared humanity at the start of a new millennium. As he is still far from even reaching northeastern Asia mid-July 2019. it is unlikely he will complete his journey within the originally-expected seven years.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Salopek height</b> Not available right now.
