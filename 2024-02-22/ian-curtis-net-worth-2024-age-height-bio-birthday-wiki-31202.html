Lead vocalist and songwriter for the post-punk band Joy Division, the group that released the songs “She’s Lost Control” and “Transmission.”</p><p>Curtis and <a href=#>Peter Hook</a> were bandmates in Joy Division.</p><p>Curtis was born on 15 July 1956, at the Memorial Hospital in Stretford, Lancashire, and grew up in a working-class household in Macclesfield, Cheshire. He was the first of two children born to Kevin and Doreen Curtis. From an early age, Curtis was a bookish and intelligent child, displaying a particular flair for poetry. He was awarded a scholarship at the age of 11 at Macclesfield’s independent King’s School. Here, he developed his interests in philosophy, literature, and eminent poets such as Thom Gunn. While at King’s School, he was awarded several scholastic awards in recognition of his abilities; particularly at the ages of 15 and 16. The year after Ian had graduated from King’s School, the Curtis family purchased a house from a relative, and moved to New Moston.</p><p>Ian Kevin Curtis (15 July 1956&nbsp;– 18 May 1980) was an English singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division and recorded two albums with the group: Unknown Pleasures (1979) and Closer (1980). Curtis was known for his bass-baritone voice, dance style, and songwriting typically filled with imagery of desolation, emptiness, and alienation.</p><p align=justify>He married his high school friend, Deborah Woodruff, on August 23, 1975; his daughter, Natalie, was born on April 16, 1979.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ian Curtis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Curtis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stretford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Deborah Curtis</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Natalie Curtis</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ian Curtis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>At a July 1976 Sex Pistols gig at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall, Curtis encountered three childhood school friends named Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason. The trio informed Curtis—whom they had seen at earlier punk gigs at The Electric Circus—of their intentions to form a band, and Curtis informed them of his then-recent efforts to do likewise, before proposing himself as both their singer and lyricist. Initially, Mason became the band’s drummer, but his rehearsal sessions were largely unproductive, and he briefly became the band’s manager. The group then unsuccessfully attempted to recruit several drummers before selecting Stephen Morris in August 1977. The band was later managed by Rob Gretton, who—having already seen Joy Division perform live at local venues such as Rafters—offered to become their manager in 1978.</p><h2>Ian Curtis Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ian Curtis is one of the <strong>richest Punk Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ian Curtis</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Even though he struggled in school, he was awarded a scholarship to The King’s School in Macclesfield when he was eleven years old.</p><p align=justify>His life and death has been dramatized in the films 24 Hour Party People in 2002 and Control in 2007.</p><p align=justify>Initially, the band named themselves “Warsaw”, from the title of a song on David Bowie’s then-recent album Low, but as this name somewhat conflicted with that of a London-based group named “Warsaw Pakt”, they renamed themselves “Joy Division”. This moniker was derived from the 1955 novel The House of Dolls, which featured a Nazi concentration camp with a sexual slavery wing called the “Joy Division”. The cover of the band’s first EP depicted a drawing of a Hitler Youth beating a drum and the A-side contained a song, “Warsaw”, which was a musical retelling of the life of Nazi leader Rudolf Hess.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the early hours of the next morning, Curtis committed suicide by hanging in his kitchen. He was 23 years old. Deborah found his body soon after; he had used the kitchen’s washing line to hang himself, having written a note to Deborah in which he declared his love for her despite his recent affair with Honoré. In her biography, Touching from a Distance, Deborah recalls finding her husband’s body and initially thinking that he was still alive before noticing the washing line around his neck. According to Tony Wilson, Curtis spent the few hours before his suicide watching Werner Herzog’s 1977 film Stroszek and listening to Iggy Pop’s 1977 album The Idiot. His wife recollected that he had taken photographs of their wedding and their baby daughter off the walls, apparently to view them as he composed his suicide note.</p><p>Curtis began suffering epileptic seizures in late 1978; he was officially diagnosed with the condition on 23 January the following year, with his particular case being described by doctors as so severe, his “life would [be] ruled to obsolescence by his severe epilepsy” without the various strong dosages of medications he was prescribed. Having joined the British Epilepsy Association, Curtis was initially open to discuss his condition with anyone who inquired, although he soon became withdrawn, and reluctant to discuss any issue regarding his condition beyond the most mundane and necessary aspects. On each occasion it became apparent a particular prescribed medication failed to control Curtis’s seizures, his doctor would prescribe a different anticonvulsant, and his wife noted his being “full of renewed enthusiasm” that this particular formulation would help him bring his seizures under control.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ian Curtis height</b> <strong>6 feet 1 inches</strong> Ian <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 1 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On 23 August 1975, Curtis married Deborah Woodruff, to whom he was introduced by a friend, Tony Nuttall. Ian and Deborah initially became friends then began dating in December 1972, when both were 16 years old. Their wedding service was conducted at St Thomas’ Church in Henbury, Cheshire. Curtis was 19 and Woodruff 18. They had one child, a daughter named Natalie, born on 16 April 1979. Initially, the couple lived with Ian’s grandparents, although shortly after their marriage, the couple moved to a working-class neighbourhood in Chadderton, where they paid a mortgage while working in jobs neither enjoyed. Before long, the couple became disillusioned with life in Oldham, and remortgaged their house before briefly returning to live with Ian’s grandparents. Shortly thereafter, in May 1977, the couple moved into their own house in Barton Street, Macclesfield, with one of the rooms of the property becoming colloquially known between the couple as Curtis’ “song-writing room”.</p><p align=justify>After founding Factory Records with Alan Erasmus, Tony Wilson signed the band to his label following the band’s first appearance on the TV music show he hosted, So It Goes, in September 1978. This appearance had been largely prompted by an abusive letter sent to Wilson by Curtis, and saw the band play the song “Shadowplay”.</p><h2>Who is Ian Curtis Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ian Curtis</strong> married to <strong>Deborah Curtis </strong>.

Although predominantly a singer, Curtis also played guitar on a handful of tracks (usually when Sumner was playing synthesizer; “Incubation” and a Peel session version of “Transmission” were rare instances when both Sumner and Curtis played guitar). Initially, Curtis played Sumner’s Shergold Masquerader, but in September 1979 he acquired his own guitar, a Vox Phantom VI Special (often described incorrectly as a Teardrop or ordinary Phantom model) which had many built-in effects used both live and in studio.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ian Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Punk Singer</strong>.

Throughout Joy Division’s live performances in 1979 and 1980, Curtis collapsed several times while performing and had to be carried off stage. To minimise any possibility of Curtis having epileptic seizures, flashing lights were prohibited at Joy Division gigs; despite these measures, Bernard Sumner later stated that certain percussion effects would cause Curtis to suffer a seizure. In April 1980, Terry Mason was appointed as a minder to ensure Curtis took his prescribed medications, avoided alcohol consumption, and got sufficient sleep.</p><h3>What did Ian Curtis suffer from?</h3><p>London (CNN) It has been 42 years since Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the legendary post-punk rock band Joy Division, took his own life.
