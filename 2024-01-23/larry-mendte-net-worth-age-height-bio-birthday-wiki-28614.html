Lawrence David Mendte (born January 16, 1957) is an American news anchor, commentator and radio talk show host. Mendte is currently hosting three TV shows, Jersey Matters, The Delaware Way, and Another Thing with Larry Mendte. Mendte also hosts The Larry Mendte Show on WABC (AM) in New York. Until a few years ago, Mendte wrote and delivered nightly commentaries at WPIX in New York City that were aired at TV stations across the country. He continued writing and delivering the commentaries on “Another Thing with Larry Mendte,” which airs in the New York and Philadelphia TV markets. Mendte was the first male host of the American syndicated television show Access Hollywood. From 2003 to mid-2008, he was the lead anchor of the 6pm and 11pm newscasts for KYW-TV (Channel 3), the CBS O&O in Philadelphia. After nearly two decades in last place, Mendte led the station to compete with first place WPVI-TV (Channel 6). KYW lured Mendte away from WCAU-TV (Channel 10), where he had anchored the 4, 6 and 11&nbsp;pm newscasts and led the station to win news ratings in some time slots for the first time in 30 years.</p><p>Mendte is married to Dawn Stensland, the former 10&nbsp;pm news co-anchor at Fox’s WTXF (Channel 29), since 2000. She came to Philadelphia in 1997 as an anchor for KYW, then anchored CBS News Saturday Morning for a year and a half. In the 1990s, she was an anchor and reporter at WBBM in Chicago, Illinois, and WKYC in Cleveland, Ohio. Together, they have two sons: Michael was born in 2004, and David was born in 2006. In addition, Mendte has two adult children, Stacia and Jonathan, from a previous marriage.</p><p>Born and raised in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, he attended St. Philomena Catholic School elementary school. During this time he began delivering the Philadelphia Bulletin. Mendte graduated from Monsignor Bonner High School in nearby Drexel Hill. In 2003, Mendte was inducted into the high school’s Hall of Fame. He earned a B.A. in Communications from West Chester University and was named a distinguished alumnus.

He wrote and directed four short documentaries. Ben Franklin: Stealing Lightning from the Sky aired across the country on Benjamin Franklin’s birthday in 2006. The documentary questioned whether Franklin really did conduct his famous kite experiment. Later that year Mendte wrote and directed Alex Scott: A Stand for Hope, a short documentary about Alex Scott, founder of Alex’s Lemonade Stand. Alex Scott: A Stand for Hope won the award for Best Documentary at the Reno, Oxford, Danville, West Chester, Lake Arrowhead and Reel Award film Festivals. Mendte was named best Pennsylvania Filmmaker for 2006 at the West Chester Film Festival.</p><p align=justify>Mendte left Access Hollywood in 1997 to return to Philadelphia and become the main anchor of WCAU (Channel 10)’s newscasts, including the 4&nbsp;pm, 6pm and 11&nbsp;pm programs, with the 4&nbsp;pm show being the first on at that time in the market.
