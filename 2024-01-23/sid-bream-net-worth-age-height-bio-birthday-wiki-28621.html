However, Drabek gave up a leadoff double to Terry Pendleton, then allowed another runner, David Justice, on an infield error by second baseman José Lind. After Drabek walked Bream to load the bases, Pirates manager Jim Leyland pulled him out of the game. Reliever Stan Belinda replaced him on the mound, and managed to get two outs, despite giving up a run on a sacrifice fly by Ron Gant. Then, Braves third-string catcher Francisco Cabrera belted a single to left field, and Justice scored easily to tie the game. Pirates left fielder and eventual National League MVP Barry Bonds fielded the ball as Bream ran toward home plate. Bonds’s throw arrived first, but it was slightly offline and bounced on its way towards the first-base line. As soon as catcher Mike LaValliere received the ball, he desperately lunged toward the plate to tag Bream out, but Bream was able to slide just underneath the tag to score the winning run and send the Braves to their second World Series in a row.</p><h3>What is Sid Bream doing now?</h3><p>Today, after baseball, Sid is spends most of his time <b>speaking in churches, youth groups and schools all over America</b>.</p><h3>Did Sid Bream win a World Series?</h3><table><tr>Sid Bream</tr><tr><td colspan=2>MLB statistics</td></tr><tr><td>Batting average</td><td>.264</td></tr><tr><td>Home runs</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Runs batted in</td><td>455</td></tr></table><h3>What year was Sid Bream slide?</h3><p>However, in the 1992 season a special event happened that went down as one of the “Greatest Plays Ever” in Braves history.
