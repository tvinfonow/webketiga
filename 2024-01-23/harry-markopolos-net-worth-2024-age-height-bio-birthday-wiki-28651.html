Who is Harry Markopolos dating now & how much money does Harry Markopolos have?</p><h2>Harry Markopolos Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Harry Markopolos</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Investor</strong> who was born on <strong>October 22, 1956</strong> in Erie, Pennsylvania, <strong>United States</strong>. Harry M. Markopolos, born October 22, 1956 in America, is a former executive in the securities industry and an investigator of financial fraud and forensic accounting.</p><p>Markopolos told Steve Kroft, 60 Minutes that the most concerning thing he saw in his 1999 Madoff analysis was the fact that he reported only losing four percent of his months.&nbsp;Markopolos believes that no one can be as good given the volatility of markets.&nbsp;He said, “Markets go up and down, but his only went up.”&nbsp;Markopolos pointed out that he traded with many of the largest derivatives companies around the globe during his time at Rampart. None of them ever dealt with Madoff because they weren’t convinced his numbers were real.&nbsp;He acknowledged that he had a financial incentive to get rid of Madoff because they competed from 2000 to 2004.&nbsp;He said he felt compelled by the opportunity because “when someone’s playing on your field, who’s dirty, you want him to be thrown off the field.”&nbsp;He blasted the SEC for not listening to him, claiming that Madoff ultimately fell under the weight his own lies.</p><p>During 1999, Markopolos learned that one of Rampart’s frequent trading partners, Access International Advisors, was dealing with a hedge fund manager who consistently delivered net returns of 1% to 2% a month.</p><p>From 1999 to 2008, Markopolos uncovered evidence that suggested that Bernie Madoff’s wealth management business was a huge Ponzi scheme. In 2000, 2001, and 2005, Markopolos alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of his views, supplying supporting documents, but each time the SEC ignored him or gave his evidence only a cursory investigation. Madoff was finally revealed to be a fraud in December 2008, when his sons contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After admitting to operating the largest private Pyramid scheme in history, Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison. In 2010, Markopolos’ book on uncovering the Madoff fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller, was published. Markopolos has criticized the SEC for failing to discover the Madoff fraud despite repeated tips, and for failing to investigate properly the larger companies it supervised. He described the private moments he had with victims of the Madoff fraud as: “Heartfelt, gut-wrenching things. People trying to commit suicide or losing loved ones who’ve died of heartbreak.”</p><p align=justify>He was a portfolio manager for Boston-based options trading firm Rampart Investment Management from 1991 to 2004 and eventually became its chief investment officer.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harry Markopolos</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Markopolos</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Investor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Erie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Louie Harry, Harry Louie</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Harry Markopolos ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>With the help of two of his colleagues at Rampart, Casey and fellow quant Neil Chelo, Markopolos continued to probe the Madoff operation. What they found concerned him enough that he filed a formal complaint with the Boston office of the SEC during the spring of 2000. However, the SEC took no action. Nonetheless, some in the investing world were heeding Markopolis’s findings. Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments dropped his plans to study Madoff’s strategies after a meeting with Markopolis in 2000 convinced Tillinghast that Madoff was almost certainly engaging in fraud. Tillinghast later wrote: “nothing in Madoff’s ostensible strategy made sense.” Michael Ocrant, editor-in-chief of MARHedge, joined the effort to publicize Madoff’s questionable actions. Casey surprised Ocrant with information that Madoff, whom Ocrant only knew to be one of the largest market makers on NASDAQ and one of the largest brokers on the New York Stock Exchange, actually ran a secretive multi-billion dollar hedge fund, directly managing investors’ money. Ocrant investigated and wrote an article, “Madoff tops charts; skeptics ask how”, published May 1, 2001, questioning Madoff’s returns. Within a week, Erin Arvedlund followed with an investigative article in Barron’s, further questioning Madoff’s secrecy and results; despite the details in these scathing articles, they generated no action from the SEC, and did not scare off Madoff’s existing investors.</p><h2>Harry Markopolos Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Harry Markopolos is one of the <strong>richest Investor</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Harry Markopolos</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Markopolos was raised in Roman Catholic schools and graduated from Cathedral Preparatory School, Erie, Pennsylvania in 1974.&nbsp;In 1981, he received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Loyola College, Maryland, and in 1997, a Master in Science in Finance from Boston College, both Catholic schools.&nbsp;He is a CFA charterholder and a Certified Fraud Examiner.</p><p align=justify>In 1987, he began his career as a broker at Makefield Securities in Erie.&nbsp;He was an assistant portfolio manager at Darien Capital Management, Darien, Connecticut in 1988.</p><p align=justify>Markopolos had originally concealed his identity from SEC regulators during May 1999, although he did meet face-to-face with SEC officials in Boston during 2000 and 2001. After the SEC did not respond, Markopolos was fearful of taking his complaints to the industry’s self-regulatory authority, the National Association of Securities Dealers (since succeeded by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Investor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On December 17, 2002, Markopolos came up with a plan to deliver an investigative file anonymously to an aide of then-Attorney General of New York Eliot Spitzer as Spitzer delivered a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. He put on a pair of white gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints, and wore an oversize coat.</p><p>Even after leaving Rampart in 2004, frustrated that he was in a business that had to compete with cheats and lawbreakers, Markopolos continued to be driven by the intellectual challenge of solving the problem, and the ongoing encouragement from Boston SEC staffer Ed Manion. The culmination of Markopolos’ analysis was a 21-page memo sent during November 2005 to SEC regulators, entitled “The World’s Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud”. It outlined his suspicions in more detail and invited officials to check his theories. He outlined 30 red flags that he believed proved Madoff’s returns could not be legitimate. His analysis was based on more than 14 years of Madoff return numbers, during which time Madoff reported only four losing months, an implausible scenario that Markopolos said could be achieved only by fraud. In the document Markopolos states:</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Harry Markopolos height</b> Not available right now.

There was an abject failure by the regulatory agencies we entrust as our watchdog,” he said in 65 pages of prepared testimony. He said that his original 2000 complaint gave the SEC enough evidence to stop Madoff when he was supposedly managing as little as $3 billion.</p><p align=justify>He not only feared the power Madoff’s brother, Peter, had in that organization (he is a former Vice Chairman), but also feared that Madoff might have had associations with Russian and South American organized crime. Markopolos believed the FBI would reject his allegations without the SEC staff’s endorsement. He believed that only a few SEC officials, including Manion and SEC Boston branch chief Mike Garrity, understood Madoff’s operation well enough to detect the fraud. Markopolos met with Garrity during 2005, and said that while Garrity realized almost immediately that Madoff was violating the law, he could not take any action because Madoff was not based in New England.</p><h2>Who is Harry Markopolos Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Harry Markopolos</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Cheung approved an internal memo during November 2007 to close an SEC investigation of Madoff without bringing any claim. Subsequently, she left the agency. He testified he gave details about the case during 2005 to John Wilke, an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, but that it was never pursued. Markopolos testified he (anonymously) sent a package of documents concerning Madoff to former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had successfully prosecuted a number of securities fraud cases, but that Spitzer apparently did not act, either. Spitzer’s family firm had invested in Madoff’s business.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Harry Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Investor</strong>.

Harry Markopolos celebrates birthday on October 22 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Although Madoff’s scheme did not collapse until 2008, Markopolos believed that Madoff was on the brink of insolvency as early as the summer of 2005, when Casey found out that at least two banks were no longer lending money to their clients to invest with Madoff. This prompted Madoff to seek loans from banks. In June 2008&nbsp;— six months before Madoff’s scheme imploded&nbsp;— Markopolos’ team uncovered evidence that Madoff was accepting leveraged money. In his book, Markopolos wrote that this was a sign Madoff was running out of cash and needed to increase his intake of new funds to keep the scheme going.</p><h3>Where is Harry Markopolos now?</h3><p>Today, he <b>works as a forensic accounting analyst for attorneys suing companies under the False Claims Act</b>.
