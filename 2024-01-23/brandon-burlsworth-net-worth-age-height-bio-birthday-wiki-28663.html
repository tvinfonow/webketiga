Brandon Burlsworth celebrates birthday on September 20 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 2001, the book Through the Eyes of a Champion: The Brandon Burlsworth Story written by Jeff Kinley was released. The book was praised for its authentic, inspirational portrayal of Brandon’s story. The book contains a foreword by former University of Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles, and it was the inspiration for a movie (see below). The book was re-released in August 2016 as a tie-in with the movie, renamed Greater: The Brandon Burlsworth Story.</p><h3>What caused Brandon Burlsworth accident?</h3><p>A state police report said that, “for unknown reasons,” <b>Burlsworth’s car drove left of the center line and hit the left front fender of a tractor trailer</b>. After returning to its lane briefly, the car crossed the center line again and hit a second tractor trailer. Burlsworth was declared dead at the scene.</p><h3>Did the Colts pay Brandon Burlsworth family?</h3><p>At halftime of the team’s season-opener against Buffalo, <b>Colts owners Jim and Meg Irsay presented Burlsworth’s family and Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles with checks for $5,000 each.</b></p><h3>What happened to Brandon Burlsworth Arkansas?</h3><p>Tragically, at the age of 22, 10 days after the draft, he was <b>killed in a car accident</b> on April 28th, 1999 while on his way home from the University of Arkansas to attend church with his mom.</p><h3>How accurate is the movie Greater?</h3><p>Unlike most cinematic adaptations, “Greater” had to do very little to embellish the story. <b>The film is meticulously modeled after the true life story of the former walk-on from Harrison, Arkansas</b>. Often times in death, we idolize individuals in an enhanced way beyond what they truly represented in life.</p><h3>Who is the old man whittling in the movie greater?</h3><p>The present part of the film shows us Martin Burlsworth, Brandon’s older brother by 17 years. He is struggling with his faith. A whittling farmer (<b>Nick Searcy</b>) is cast as a faith antagonist because film makers believe they must have one to create a message. This is an excellent faith based film.</p>You may read full biography about Brandon Burlsworth from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfl7%2BiusOopWaapae5tMPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-23%2fbrandon-burlsworth-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28663.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/2024-01-23/cheech-marin-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28659.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/2024-01-23/cheech-marin-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28659.html>Cheech Marin Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/2024-01-23/brad-palmer-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28649.html>Brad Palmer Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/2024-01-23/brad-palmer-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28649.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
