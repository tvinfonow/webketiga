In an interview, he admitted that changing his name from “Ricky” to “Rick” at 18, upon prompting by his agent, was a mistake. ” ‘Rick’ never really fit,” he said. “I tried for 18 years to make it work, and no one wanted to call me ‘Rick’. It should always have been ‘Ricky’. That’s what it always should have been, so I’m going back to it.”</p><p>After graduating from high school, Schroder enrolled himself in Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado.

He eventually bought a large piece of land in Colorado. His co-starring role in the Western miniseries Lonesome Dove and its sequel, Return to Lonesome Dove, helped in his attempt to be recognized in more mature roles. His roles as Danny Sorenson on three seasons of NYPD Blue, nurse Paul Flowers in Scrubs, Dr. Dylan West on Strong Medicine, and Mike Doyle on the 2007 season of 24 worked to cement that perception with the viewing audience.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ricky Schroder height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Ricky <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Schroder married Andrea Bernard in 1992, and they have four children.
