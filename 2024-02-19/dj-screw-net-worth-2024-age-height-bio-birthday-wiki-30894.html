A look at the Houston hip-hop DJ scene, which was the first to pioneer the now famous Chopped and Screwed technique.&nbsp;His most famous albums include 3’n The Mornin” The Part Two along with Since the Gray Tapes Vol.&nbsp;2.</p><p>He had a hand in the work of multiplatinum-selling artist&nbsp;He influenced the work of multiplatinum rapper <a href=#>Lil Flip</a>..</p><p>Robert Earl Davis Jr. (July 20, 1971 – November 16, 2000), better known by his stage name DJ Screw, was an American hip hop DJ based in Houston, Texas, and best known as the creator of the now-famous chopped and screwed DJ technique. He was a central and influential figure in the Houston hip hop community and was the leader of Houston’s Screwed Up Click.</p><p>Davis began DJing at age 12 in 1983, and started his trademark slowed-down mixes in 1990, the style became his main focus in late 1991 – early 1992. The mixes began as special compilations requested by friends and those in the know. He soon made them available for sale when his close friend Toe offered to buy a mix from him for ten dollars. At that point, customers had increasingly begun requesting his more well-known mixes instead of personalized lists. During the early 1990s, he invited some of the Houston MCs from the city’s south side to rhyme on those mixes. This coalition of emcees eventually became the fathers of the Screwed Up Click. Many members of the Screwed Up Click, or S.U.C., are considered key figures in the canon of Houston hip hop. The original lineup included Big Hawk, Big Moe, E.S.G., and Fat Pat, among others. The crew later gained then upcoming artists such as, Z-Ro , Trae tha Truth as well as Lil Flip.

His father, Robert Earl Davis Sr., was a long-haul truck driver based in Houston. His mother Ida May Deary (who had a young daughter from a previous marriage), came to the area to be with her mother when her son was born in 1971. She returned to Houston, but the marriage was floundering; soon it would be over, and she and her kids moved to Los Angeles for a couple of years, then back to Houston, and returned to Smithville in 1980 when Davis was age nine.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DJ</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On November 16, 2000, Davis was found dead inside of his Houston recording studio in the 8100 block of Commerce Park Drive.

His admiration of classical music drove him to resume piano lessons. After seven years of practice, he was able to play works like Chopin’s Etude in C major by ear. His musical interest shifted as he took his mother’s B.B. King and Johnnie Taylor records and scratched them on the turntable the way DJs did, slowing the spinning disc and then allowing it to speed back up, playing with sound.</p><p align=justify>DJ Screw has been a considerable influence in the Houston scene and beyond, “helping to cement his legacy as an underappreciated avant-gardist, creator of a sui generis sound that’s still growing and mutating.” Texas governor Rick Perry honored him by making him an official Texas Music Pioneer. The Houston Press named the 1995 album 3 ‘n the Mornin’ (Part Two) as no. 13 on its list of the 25 best Houston rap albums of all time, crediting the release for the way it helped shape Houston’s hip-hop culture. When the Houston hip-hop scene became nationally prominent in 2004, many of the biggest acts could be traced to DJ Screw’s crew, the Screwed Up Click. Many artists outside of Houston rap have been influenced by Screw’s work, including experimental electronic artists such as Oneohtrix Point Never, Balam Acab, How to Dress Well, and Rabit.</p><h2>Who is DJ Screw Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>DJ Screw</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
