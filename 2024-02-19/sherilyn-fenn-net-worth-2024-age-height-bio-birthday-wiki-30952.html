In October 1990, while promoting Twin Peaks, Fenn made the cover of Rolling Stone magazine along with Mädchen Amick and Lara Flynn Boyle. In 1990 Us Magazine chose her as one of the “10 Most Beautiful Women in the World” and in 1991 People magazine chose her as one of the “50 Most Beautiful Women in the World”. She posed for photographer Steven Meisel for the autumn-winter 1991–1992 Dolce & Gabbana campaign, for which he photographed her as a classical Hollywood femme fatale. In 1992, photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of Sherilyn Fenn, Sharon Stone, Julian Sands, Raquel Welch, Eric Roberts, and Sean Penn. In these portraits, he recreated his style of the 1930s, with Fenn posing in costumes, hairstyle, and makeup of the period.</p><p>Shortly after shooting the Twin Peaks’ pilot episode, David Lynch gave her a small part in Wild at Heart, as a girl injured in a car wreck, obsessed by the contents of her purse, alongside Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. The film won the Golden Palm Award at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. “David’s direction was, ‘Only think of this: bobby pins, lipstick, wallet, comb, that’s it.’ It’s very abstract.” “I just pictured her being able to do this,” said Lynch of her scene, “she’s like a broken China doll.” David Lynch, who once described Sherilyn Fenn as “five feet of heaven in a ponytail” (quoting from a 1958 record by The Playmates), said to Banner, who used that description as the title of his article, “She’s a mysterious girl and I think that actresses like her who have a mystery – where there’s something hiding beneath the surface – are the really interesting ones.” “He’s very creative and unafraid of taking chances,” she said of the director. “I really respect him. He’s wonderful.” Also during this period, Fenn appeared on the cover and in a nude pictorial in the December 1990 edition of Playboy magazine.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sherilyn Fenn height</b> <strong>5 ft 4 in</strong> Sherilyn <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Fenn dated pop singer Prince for a short time during 1985 and then Johnny Depp in 1986; their relationship lasted several years.</p><p align=justify>In 1991, Hollywood acting coach Roy London chose her to star in his directorial debut Diary of a Hitman, in which she plays a young mother determined to protect her child from hit man Forest Whitaker.

The series ran from 1990 to 1991, and the character of Audrey was one of the most popular with fans, in particular for her unrequited love for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan) and her style from the 1950s (with her saddle shoes, plaid skirts, and tight sweaters). Fenn reached cult status with a scene in which she danced to Angelo Badalamenti’s music and a scene in which she knotted a cherry stem in her mouth. “With Sherilyn Fenn, Twin Peaks came on and effortlessly destroyed every other show’s sexuality”, said James Marshall, one of her cast-mates. Speaking in September 1990, Fenn pointed out: “Audrey is a woman-child who dresses like the girls in the ’50s and shows her body. But she’s daddy’s little girl at the same time.” In the show’s second season, when the idea of pairing Audrey with Cooper was abandoned, Audrey was paired with other characters like Bobby Briggs (played by Dana Ashbrook) and John Justice Wheeler (Billy Zane).

After Twin Peaks, Fenn chose to focus on widening her range of roles and was determined to avoid typecasting. She stated, “They’ve offered me every variation on Audrey Horne, none of which were as good or as much fun.” She turned down the Audrey Horne spinoff series that was offered to her, and unlike most of the cast, chose not to return for the 1992 prequel movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, as she was then shooting Of Mice and Men.</p><h3>What is Sherilyn Fenn doing now?</h3><p>Fenn had recurring roles on Gilmore Girls and Showtime drama Ray Donovan, and is currently <b>portraying Queenie on Emmy nominated Showtime drama Shameless</b>.
