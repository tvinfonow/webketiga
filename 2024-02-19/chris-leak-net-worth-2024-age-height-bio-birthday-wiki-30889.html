He started all of Florida’s games, including a memorable school record-tying six-touchdown performance against the South Carolina Gamecocks. However, following a disappointing loss to the unranked Mississippi State Bulldogs and an on-campus confrontation with fraternity members, head coach Ron Zook was fired.

Leak received national attention as an 8th grader in 1998 when Wake Forest coach Jim Caldwell, who had just signed his older brother, C. J., offered him a college football scholarship. He attended Independence High School in Charlotte, where he played for the Independence Patriots high school football team. In four years as the Patriots’ starting quarterback, Leak led his team to three consecutive North Carolina 4-A state championships. He set North Carolina state records for passing yards in a career (15,593) and completions in a career (1,013), as well as the national record for touchdown passes in a career (185). He is considered by some to be the greatest high school quarterback of all time. He was recognized as a Parade magazine All-American as well as Parade’s Player of the Year in 2003. The Scout.com recruiting service ranked Leak as a five-star prospect and the third-best quarterback in the 2003 recruiting class.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Leak was listed on the SEC Academic Honor Roll each year he attended Florida, and was a finalist for the Draddy Trophy, also known as the “Academic Heisman” for college football players. He graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree in sociology, with honors, in December 2006, and was a keynote speaker during the graduation ceremony.</p><p>Before the beginning of his 2006 senior season, there was speculation that Leak might not be the Gators’ starting quarterback due to the emergence of talented freshman Tim Tebow. Instead, Meyer publicly endorsed Leak as the starting quarterback and confirmed Tim Tebow would be the back-up. Preseason analysis projected that Florida would have the hardest schedule in the country, including back-to-back games against Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, LSU, Auburn and Georgia. The 2006 season proved to be a redemption year for Leak: leading the Gators to their first SEC Championship since 2000, and a spot in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game against Ohio State Buckeyes (the Gators’ first championship game appearance since 1996). Leak also broke many Gators’ passing records set by Heisman Trophy-winner Danny Wuerffel, including Wuerffel’s record for career passing yards set during the 2006 SEC championship game. Leak again received second-team All-SEC honors.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Chris Leak height</b> Not available right now.

Dan Mullen was introduced as the new offensive coordinator—Leak’s third offensive coordinator in three years. Heading into his 2005 junior season, Leak had to learn his third offensive scheme in as many years, but was touted as a possible Heisman Trophy candidate. Leak won his first five games, including a big win over the SEC East rival Tennessee Volunteers, but struggled in the option portion of the Meyer’s offense. Since Leak was a drop-back passer and not the ideal choice to run Meyer’s spread option offense, Meyer tweaked the offense to tailor it to Leak’s abilities after the Gators struggled midway through its schedule. The result was successful with the team winning its last two games against ranked competition. Leak received second-team All-SEC honors.</p><p align=justify>Leak was not selected during the 2007 NFL Draft. The Chicago Bears signed him immediately after the draft. He spent the summer of 2007 working with the team, and training under former Gator quarterback predecessor Rex Grossman. However, Leak only saw playtime during the final game of the preseason, where he completed eleven of sixteen passes for eighty-eight yards, an interception and a touchdown. He was eventually cut from the Bears roster on September 16, 2007.</p><h2>Who is Chris Leak Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chris Leak</strong> married to <strong>Latria Leak </strong>.
