R&B singer who gained attention for her debut album, Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number, which sold three million copies in the U.S. and was certified double-platinum. Her career was cut short after she died in a plane crash in the Bahamas in 2001.</p><p>When she was ten, she appeared on the TV show Star Search with <a href=#>Gladys Knight</a>.</p><p>Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York, and was the younger child of Diane and Michael “Miguel” Haughton (1951–2012). She was of African-American descent. Her name has been described as a female version of the Arabic “Ali”, but the original Jewish name “Aliya (Hebrew: אליה)” is derived from the Hebrew word “aliyah (Hebrew: עלייה)”, meaning “highest, most exalted one, the best.” The singer was highly fond of her Semitic name, calling it “beautiful” and asserting she was “very proud of it” and strove to live up to her name every day. Aaliyah’s mother enrolled Aaliyah in voice lessons at an early age. She started performing at weddings, church choir and charity events. When Aaliyah was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was raised along with her older brother, Rashad. She attended a Catholic school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play Annie, which inspired her to become an entertainer. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson’s widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.</p><p>Aaliyah Dana Haughton (/ɑː ˈ l iː ə / ; January 16, 1979&nbsp;– August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model.

The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.</p><p align=justify>She was married to <a href=#>R.

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Aaliyah has been credited for helping redefine R&B, pop and hip hop in the 1990s, “leaving an indelible imprint on the music industry as a whole.” According to Billboard, Aaliyah revolutionized R&B with her sultry mix of pop, soul and hip hop. In a 2001 review of her eponymous album, Rolling Stone professed that Aaliyah’s impact on R&B and pop has been enormous. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote Aaliyah ranks among the “elite” artists of the R&B genre, as she “played a major role in popularizing the stuttering, futuristic production style that consumed hip-hop and urban soul in the late 1990s.” Critic Bruce Britt stated that by combining “schoolgirl charm with urban grit, Aaliyah helped define the teen-oriented sound that has resulted in contemporary pop phenom’s like Brandy, Christina Aguilera and Destiny’s Child”.</p><h2>Aaliyah Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Aaliyah is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Aaliyah</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She sang in her school choir and played Annie in her first-grade play. She signed with Blackground Records when she was twelve years old.</p><p align=justify>She starred in the 2000 action film Romeo Must Die.</p><p align=justify>Aaliyah was signed to appear in several future films, including Honey, a romantic film titled Some Kind of Blue, and a Whitney Houston-produced remake of the 1976 film Sparkle. Whitney Houston recalled Aaliyah being “so enthusiastic” about the film and wanting to appear in the film “so badly”. Houston also voiced her belief that Aaliyah was more than qualified for the role and the film was shelved after she died, since Aaliyah had “gone to a better place”. Studio officials of Warner Brothers stated that Aaliyah and her mother had both read the script for Sparkle. According to them, Aaliyah was passionate about playing the lead role of a young singer in a girl group. The film was released in 2012, eleven years after Aaliyah’s death. Before her death Aaliyah was cast in the sequels of The Matrix as the character Zee. She had filmed part of her role in The Matrix Reloaded and was scheduled to film and reprise her role in The Matrix Revolutions as Zee. Aaliyah told Access Hollywood that she was “beyond happy” to have landed the role. The role was subsequently recast to Nona Gaye. Aaliyah’s scenes were included in the tribute section of the Matrix Ultimate Collection series.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Some writers noted that Aaliyah’s “silky vocals” and “sultry voice” blended with Kelly’s new jack swing helped define R&B in the 1990s. Her sound was also compared to that of female quartet En Vogue. Christopher John Farley of Time magazine described the album as a “beautifully restrained work”, noting that Aaliyah’s “girlish, breathy vocals rode calmly on R. Kelly’s rough beats”. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the album had its “share of filler”, but described the singles as “slyly seductive”. He also claimed that the songs on the album were “frequently better” than that of Kelly’s second studio album, 12 Play. The single “At Your Best (You Are Love)” was criticized by Billboard for being out of place on the album and for its length.</p><p>Her grandmother died in 1991. Years after her death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported everyone in the family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she “spoiled” her and her brother Rashad. She also enjoyed Aaliyah’s singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah said she thought of her grandmother whenever she fell into depression. Aaliyah’s hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was very young and whom Aaliyah remembered as an “amazingly beautiful woman”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Aaliyah height</b> <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> Aaliyah <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Described as one of “R&B’s most important artists” during the 1990s, her second studio album, One in a Million, became one of the most influential R&B albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited “Are You That Somebody?” as “the most radical pop single” of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that rather than being the song’s focal point, Aaliyah “knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line”, and consequently “helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny’s Child owe a clear debt to ‘Are You That Somebody’.” Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah “had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years.” Music publication Popdust called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground for her influence on the underground alternative music scene; the publication also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah did with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are somewhat cut from the same cloth. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive mentioned that it’s easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R&B movements. Erika Ramirez, an associate editor of Billboard, said at the time of Aaliyah’s career “there weren’t many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now you see a lot of artists doing that and finding success,” her reasoning for Aaliyah’s continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah’s second album One in a Million was “very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R&B sounds that they produced”, referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which “really stood out” at its time, was being replicated. With sales of 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide, Aaliyah earned the nicknames “Princess of R&B” and “Queen of Urban Pop”, as she “proved she was a muse in her own right”. Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone dubbed her as the “undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on”. she has also has been referred to as a pop icon and a R&B icon for her impact and contributions to those respective genres.</p><p align=justify>Aaliyah reportedly developed a friendship with Kelly during the recording of her debut album. As she recalled to Vibe magazine in 1994, she and Kelly would “go watch a movie” and “go eat” when she got tired and would then “come back and work”. She described the relationship between her and Kelly as being “rather close.” In 2016, Kelly said that he was as in love with Aaliyah as he was with “anybody else.” In December 1994, Aaliyah told the Sun-Times that whenever she was asked about being married to Kelly, she urged them not to believe “all that mess” and that she and Kelly were “close” and “people took it the wrong way.” In his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out, Demetrius Smith Sr., a former member of Kelly’s entourage, wrote that Kelly told him “in a voice that sounded as if he wanted to burst into tears” that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.</p><h2>Who is Aaliyah Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Aaliyah</strong> married to <strong>R.

Or that she was coming and going in and out of his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men.” Brown later added “at 15, you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Aaliyah Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular R&B Singer</strong>.
