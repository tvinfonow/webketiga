In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, Fisher played in all 50 games and started in 21, mostly serving as a backup for veteran Derek Harper. Fisher would once again start in all of the Lakers’ playoff games, posting averages of 9.8 points and 4.9 assists per game as the Lakers advanced past the Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in the second round in 4 games.</p><p align=justify>He had four children with Candace Patton, whom he was married to from 2005 until 2015.

Fisher played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 18 seasons, spending the majority of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won five NBA championships.

During his absence, the Lakers were not winning as frequently as the previous season, which led to teammates Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal rekindling their feud over the team’s offense. Assistant coach Bill Bertka, however, believed a key factor in the team’s struggles was the team’s defense without Fisher. Fisher returned on March 13, 2001, upgrading the Lakers’ defense, and he started the final 20 games of the season, averaging 11.5 points per game. Harper had been the regular starter, but he was sidelined since February 13 with injuries to both knees. The Lakers finished the regular season with an eight-game winning streak, and ended with 56 wins. Fisher started all of the Lakers 16 playoff games as they swept through the Western Conference, averaging 13.4 points per game and shooting a team best 51 percent from beyond the three-point line. This included a career-high 28 points on 6 for 7 three-point shooting in Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in 5 games, bolstered by Fisher’s 18 points on 6 of 8 shooting from three-point range in game 5 to help clinch the Lakers’ second straight title.</p><p>By the 2002–03 season, Fisher had established himself as the Lakers’ primary point guard, starting in all 82 games. But the team was eliminated in the Western Conference Semifinals by the eventual champion Spurs that spring, and this was followed by the signing of veteran point guard Gary Payton in the summer. As a result, Fisher was demoted back to the bench for the 2003–04 season. During NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the Los Angeles team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Derek Fisher height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Derek <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Phil Jackson became the Lakers’ head coach prior to the 1999–2000 season, and with him brought veteran point guard Ron Harper, who had started for three of Jackson’s Chicago Bulls championship teams. Jackson historically preferred big guards. Being both smaller and playing more like a traditional point guard, and not being much of a shooter, Fisher worked hard on his shooting during the offseason to increase his value to the new coach. He started in 22 of 78 games for the season, backing up both Harper and Kobe Bryant when injured. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games to win the 2000 NBA championship, Fisher’s first.</p><p align=justify>On July 15, 2004, Fisher signed a six-year, $37 million contract with the Golden State Warriors. Fisher’s two-season term with Golden State proved to be somewhat of a disappointment. While he was a reliable spot-up shooter, Fisher saw limited openings without a star player such as Bryant or O’Neal to command a double-team. The team as a whole continued to struggle mightily and languished near the bottom of the Western Conference standings.</p><h2>Who is Derek Fisher Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Derek Fisher</strong> married to <strong>Candace Fisher </strong>.
