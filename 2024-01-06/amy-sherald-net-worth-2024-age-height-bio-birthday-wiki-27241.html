Who is Amy Sherald dating now & how much money does Amy Sherald have?</p><h2>Amy Sherald Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Amy Sherald</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Painter</strong> who was born on <strong>August 30, 1973</strong> in Columbus, <strong></strong>. My mother did not want me to become an artist. She was a black woman born in 1930s Alabama where everything was really about surviving. I always say that she was the perfect mother for me, because what I needed was somebody to prove wrong. I’m a strong woman because I was raised by one, and I’m a better person for that.</p><p>Sherald received a B.A. degree in painting in 1997 Clark Atlanta University. After an apprenticeship with Arturo Lindsay, an art history professor at Spelman College, she attended the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), receiving an M.F.A. degree in painting in 2004. While attending MICA, Sherald studied with abstract expressionist painter Grace Hartigan, from whom she learned the “dripping method” of painting. She later followed up her studies with painter Odd Nerdrum in Larvik, Norway.</p><p>She first came to prominence in 2016 when her painting, Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance), won the National Portrait Gallery’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The competition noted that “Sherald creates innovative, dynamic portraits that, through color and form, confront the psychological effects of stereotypical imagery on African-American subjects”. She was the first woman and first African-American to win the competition.</p><p>The year after Sherald won the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, she was chosen by First Lady Michelle Obama to paint her official portrait. On February 12, 2018 the National Portrait Gallery unveiled the portrait, making Sherald the first African-American woman to paint an official First Lady portrait. The double portrait unveiling ceremony was attended by Barack and Michelle Obama. It was noted that Sherald and Kehinde Wiley, the painter of Barack Obama’s portrait, were the first African-American artists to make official presidential portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, and also as artists who each early on prioritized African-American portraiture. Holland Cotter noted in a review that they both blend fact and fiction in their portraiture.</p><p align=justify>In 1997, Sherald participated in Spelman College International Artist-in-Residence program in Portobelo, Panama. She prepared and curated shows in the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo and the 1999 South American Biennale in Lima, Peru. She has taught art in the Baltimore City Detention Center, and in 2008 she did a residency the Tongxian Art Center in Beijing, China.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amy Sherald</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Painter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Columbus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Geraldine Sherald, Amos P.
