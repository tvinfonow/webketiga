Data obtained by NBC News contradicted Sanders’s assertion, showing that from October 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 only six immigrants on the No Fly List (also known as the terror watch list) were encountered at the ports of entry on the Mexico border. In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News, Wallace countered her claim of nearly 4,000 terrorists, saying “I know the statistic. I didn’t know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come—where they are captured? Airports.”</p><p align=justify>After the dismissal of James Comey by President Trump in May 2017, Sanders said that she “heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the President’s decision” to fire the FBI director.

After Comey accused Trump of lying about the circumstances in which Comey was dismissed, Sanders defended Trump: “I can definitively say the president is not a liar, and I think it’s frankly insulting that question would be asked.”</p><h2>Who is Sarah Sanders Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sarah Sanders</strong> married to <strong>Bryan Chatfield Sanders </strong>.
