The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the 1990 TV series based on the 1989 comedy Parenthood. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio’s recommendation. The same scenario played itself out during casting for the 1993 movie This Boy’s Life (featuring Robert De Niro as the lead); DiCaprio got the main teen role (coincidentally, the character was named “Toby”) and Maguire got a part as one of Toby’s friends.</p><h2>Tobey Maguire Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tobey Maguire is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actor</strong> from United States.

PETA declared him the World’s Sexiest Vegetarian in 2002.

Maguire has been sober since the age of 19 after experiencing “some difficulty” with alcohol in his late teens.</p><p>As part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described “addictive and compulsive nature”, Maguire changed his career path slightly to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part, and the move paid off when given the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action, in Ang Lee’s 1997 film, The Ice Storm. This led to a variety of lead roles in films such as Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules, and Wonder Boys.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tobey Maguire height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Tobey <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By the mid-1990s, he was working steadily but was also becoming involved in the hard-partying lifestyle of some of his fellow young actors.
