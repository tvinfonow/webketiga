Bassist and singer that sang U.K.&nbsp;Single Chart’s number 6 song “War Baby,” as in addition to “Glad to Be Gay.”</p><p>He wrote several songs in collaboration along with&nbsp;He co-wrote several songs with <a href=#>Elton John</a>, including “Sartorial Eloquence (Don’t Ya Wanna Play This Game No More?).”, among them “Sartorial Eloquence (Don’t You Want To Play This Game Don’t You Want to Play This Game Anymore? ?).”</p><p>Thomas Giles Robinson (born 1 June 1950) is a British singer-songwriter, bassist, radio presenter and long-time LGBT rights activist, best known for the hits “Glad to Be Gay”, “2-4-6-8 Motorway”, and “Don’t Take No for an Answer”, with his Tom Robinson Band. He later peaked at No.&nbsp;6 in the UK Singles Chart with his solo single “War Baby”.</p><p>At the age of 13, Robinson realised that he was gay when he fell in love with another boy at school. Until 1967, male homosexual activity was a crime in England, punishable by prison. He had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide at 16. A head teacher got him transferred to Finchden Manor, a therapeutic community, in Kent, for teens with emotional difficulties, where he spent his following six years. At the community, Robinson was inspired by John Peel’s The Perfumed Garden on pirate Radio London, and by a visit from Alexis Korner. The legendary bluesman and broadcaster transfixed a roomful of people, using nothing but his voice and an acoustic guitar. The whole direction of Robinson’s life and career became suddenly clear to him.</p><p align=justify>He got married Sue Brearley and has two children, however he considers himself a gay.&nbsp;He has been vocal about the criticisms from his family members, saying that he is homosexual who has fallen in love women, and to which many people agree that he’s on the right side of the law.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tom Robinson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Inspired by an early Sex Pistols gig, he founded the more political Tom Robinson Band in 1976. The following year the group released the single “2-4-6-8 Motorway”, which peaked at No.&nbsp;5 in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks. The song alludes obliquely to a gay truck driver. In February 1978, the band released the live extended play Rising Free, which peaked at No.&nbsp;18 in the UK Singles Chart and included his anthemic song “Glad to Be Gay”, originally written for a 1976 London gay pride parade. The song was banned by the BBC. In May 1978, the band released its debut album, Power in the Darkness, which was very well received, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK Albums Chart, and receiving a gold certification by the BPI. Their second album, TRB Two (1979), however, was a commercial and critical failure, and the band broke up four months after its release.</p><h2>Tom Robinson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tom Robinson is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.

They impressed Ray Davies, of The Kinks, enough for him to sign them to his Konk label and produce their debut album. According to Robinson, Davies’s other commitments made the recording a lengthy process and, after it sold only 600 copies, he left the band. Subsequently, when the Tom Robinson Band were playing at the Nashville Rooms in London, Robinson saw Davies enter and sarcastically performed The Kinks’ hit “Tired of Waiting for You”. Davies retaliated with the less-than-complimentary Kinks single “Prince of the Punks”, about Robinson.</p><p align=justify>A fictionalised version of Tom Robinson, portrayed by Mathew Baynton, appears in the last episode of the first series of the BBC One television drama Ashes to Ashes, as leader at a Gay Liberation Front protest in London. The character is later incarcerated with other protestors by the time-travelling protagonist, Detective Inspector Alex Drake (played by Keeley Hawes) and dismisses her claims that he will one day marry a woman. The scene supposedly takes place on 9 October 1981, precisely fourteen months before the real Tom Robinson met his future bride. The character then leads other protestors in singing a round of “Glad to Be Gay” in the confinement facility, much to Sergeant Viv James’ annoyance. “2-4-6-8 Motorway” is also used in the soundtrack during the protest after Detective Sergeant Ray Carling sings a few bars to Alex, who then proceeds to drive a pink tank over a parked Ford Escort, which she believes would otherwise have later been used in a car bombing. Robinson’s song “War Baby” (which he premiered the night he met his wife) is used in the soundtrack of the third series.</p><h2>Who is Tom Robinson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tom Robinson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

The band nevertheless received an enthusiastic reception at a Madison Square Garden concert with The Police. However, their management company went bankrupt, the band disintegrated, and Robinson suffered another nervous breakdown. Desolate, in debt, and sorrowing from a breakup with a beau, Robinson fled to Hamburg, Germany, much like his idol David Bowie had escaped to Berlin at a low point in his life. Living in a friend’s spare room, he began writing again and ended up working in East Berlin with local band NO55.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Tom Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>.
