Who is Martin Donnelly dating now & how much money does Martin Donnelly have?</p><h2>Martin Donnelly Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Martin Donnelly</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Racing Automobile Driver</strong> who was born on <strong>March 26, 1964</strong> in Belfast, Belfast, <strong>Northern Ireland</strong>. Hugh Peter Martin Donnelly (born 26 March 1964) is a motor racing driver from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He competed in Formula Three and Formula 3000 where he won 3 races. In the 1988 International Formula 3000 season he placed third despite only competing in the final five rounds of the championship. He raced in Formula One in 1989 and 1990, until a serious crash during qualifying at the Jerez circuit ended his Formula One career.</p><p>Donnelly worked as a driver development director for Comtec Racing in 2008. During this year, Norfolk county court records indicate Donnelly had continuing legal issues regarding driver contracts and a failure to pay child support. By 2009, Donnelly was no longer associated with Comtec Racing. In June 2010, Donnelly drove as a guest in the Ginetta G50 Cup at Oulton Park. On 2 July 2011 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Donnelly drove a Lotus 102 similar to that which nearly took his life. The Lamborghini-powered car was the same specification as the car he drove in 1990, the original car having been completely destroyed in the crash. He has been appointed as the driver representative on the FIA stewards panel for a number of F1 Grand Prix including most recently the 2012 and 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.</p><p>Donnelly made his British Touring Car Championship début in 2015, briefly driving for the works Infiniti-Support Our Paras Racing team, but the team’s plans were thrown into disarray by the marque’s subsequent withdrawal of its backing from the project, and he was replaced by Max Coates.</p><p align=justify>Donnelly has since managed to race in smaller club events, and managed a Formula Vauxhall team. His involvement in club racing ended in 2004 when he filed for bankruptcy due to failure to pay taxes and legal disputes regarding driver contracts. In 2004, Donnelly raced a Mazda RX-8 in a Silverstone 24-Hour race, finishing in 27th place. 2006 saw Donnelly return to Lotus, participating in a track day sponsored by a Lotus owner’s club. In September 2007, Donnelly beat 35 other Lotus Elises to win Class A in the Donington Park round of the Elise Trophy. This class win was closely followed by the race win in the 2nd Elise Trophy race of the day. Later in the season he raced at Spa-Francorchamps and in 2008, campaigned in a Lotus 2-Eleven. Donnelly continues to have a close relationship with Elise Trophy organisers LoTRDC, racing in a Lotus Evora in 2012 and he is currently working as a club steward for Lotus Cup Europe. In 2017 Donnelly is currently racing in FIA Lotus Cup Europe in a Motul sponsored Lotus Elise.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martin Donnelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Donnelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Racing Automobile Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belfast</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belfast</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Northern Ireland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stefan Donnelly</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Martin Donnelly ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Martin Donnelly</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>During 1988, as well as his racing commitments, Donnelly was the test driver for Lotus Formula One team. But it was during 1989 that Donnelly got his first race start when he substituted for Arrows driver Derek Warwick at the 1989 French Grand Prix after Warwick injured his back in a non-competitive karting accident. He impressed in France qualifying 14th compared to his much more experienced team mate Eddie Cheever who started 25th on the grid. Donnelly finished his first F1 race 3 laps down in 12th place and was the last car running to finish while Cheever’s experience told and he had a better race finishing only 1 lap down in 7th place.</p><p align=justify>In 1990 he continued in F1 with Lotus though this time not as a test driver but as a race driver alongside new team mate Derek Warwick.

He sustained multiple injuries in the crash, including brain and lung contusions as well as severe leg fractures, the latter of which almost necessitated the amputation of his right leg.</p><p align=justify>(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position&nbsp;– 1 point awarded in first race; races in italics indicate fastest lap&nbsp;– 1 point awarded all races; * signifies that driver lead race for at least one lap&nbsp;– 1 point awarded all races)</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Racing Automobile Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Martin Donnelly height</b> Not available right now.
