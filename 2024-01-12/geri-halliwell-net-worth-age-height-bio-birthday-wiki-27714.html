Pop singer, who was referred to by the name Ginger Spice while performing with the Spice Girls, known for hits such as “Wannabe.”</p><p>The actress was one of the Spice Girls along with&nbsp;She was part of the Spice Girls alongside <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a>, <a href=#>Melanie Janine Brown</a>, <a href=#>Emma Lee Bunton</a> and <a href=#>Melanie Jayne Chisholm</a>.,&nbsp;Melanie Janine Brown,&nbsp;Emma Lee Bunton&nbsp;and&nbsp;Melanie Jayne Chisholm.</p><p>Geraldine Estelle Horner (née Halliwell) (born 6 August 1972), is an English singer, songwriter, author, philanthropist and actress. Halliwell came to international prominence in the 1990s as Ginger Spice, a member of the wildly successful girl group the Spice Girls, which was also the best-selling girl group of all time, with over 85 million records sold, of which 75 million copies were sold with the quintet line-up including Halliwell. The phrase “girl power”, regularly uttered by all five members, was most closely associated with Halliwell. Her Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards also became an enduring symbol of girl power. In 1998, Halliwell left the Spice Girls to pursue a solo career but later returned to the group when they reunited in 2007. Halliwell reportedly amassed a $40 million fortune during her last two years in the group.</p><p>In 1994, Halliwell, along with Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown, and Victoria Beckham, responded to an advertisement in The Stage magazine. Around 400 women answered the ad and auditioned at Dance Works studios. After a couple of initial line-up changes, Halliwell, Chisholm, Brown, and Beckham (née Adams) eventually became the members of the group, along with Emma Bunton. The group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them, and in October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and artists and repertoire men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd’s Bush, where they received an “overwhelmingly positive” reaction. Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for the group. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Adams’ father Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group’s frustration at their management’s unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted with Heart Management.</p><p align=justify>She is the eldest of her siblings.
