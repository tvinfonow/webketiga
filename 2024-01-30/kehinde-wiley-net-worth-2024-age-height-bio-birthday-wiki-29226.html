American painter whose portraits of African-Americans in valiant poses have won him recognition from institutions like the United Federation of Teachers, who named him the Artist of the Year in 2011. His work has been displayed in venues like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p><p>His painting Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps is based on <a href=#>Jacques-Louis David</a>‘s Napoleon Crossing the Alps.</p><p>The twins were raised by their mother; their father had returned to Nigeria.

Wiley became an artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem.</p><p>Wiley opened a studio in Beijing, China, in 2006 to use several helpers to do brushstrokes for his paintings. Initially, outsourcing work to China had been done to cut costs but by 2012, Wiley told New York magazine that low costs was no longer the reason. Critics have long wondered about the extent to which Wiley’s paintings are painted by Wiley himself. When asked if one could visit his studio in China to watch him paint, the artist has declined. Wiley’s Beijing studio is managed by Ain Cocke, who has worked for him for close to a decade, first as a painting assistant and now as a manager.
