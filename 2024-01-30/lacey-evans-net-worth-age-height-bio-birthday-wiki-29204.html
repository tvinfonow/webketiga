In April, Evans was placed in her first feud with Sane, as the two exchanged victories and attacked each other throughout the next few weeks. Eventually, Evans lost to Sane on the June 6 episode of NXT to end their feud. Throughout the rest of the year, Evans started a winning streak, defeating the likes of Dakota Kai and Candice LeRae.

Three months later, in her first appearance on NXT, Evans teamed with Sarah Bridges in a tag team match which they lost to the team of Billie Kay and Peyton Royce. In 2017, Estrella was given the ring name Lacey Evans, which coincidentally is identical to her sister’s maiden name. She was used mostly as a jobber to various competitors. In July, Evans participated in the inaugural Mae Young Classic, defeating Taynara Conti in the first round, but losing to Toni Storm in the second round.</p><p align=justify>Shortly after WrestleMania 35, Evans was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up, and placed in her first feud on the main roster as she continuously attacked Raw and SmackDown Women’s Champion Becky Lynch.

A few minutes later, Evans helped Charlotte Flair win the SmackDown Women’s Championship from Lynch as she hit her with her finisher, the Women’s Right, and allowed her to take advantage of the attack. Throughout mid-2019, Evans continued to feud with Lynch and chase her for the Raw Women’s Championship. At Stomping Grounds she lost again to Lynch, and in the main event, was Baron Corbin’s choice for a special referee for the Universal Championship match, due to Rollins dating Lynch. Evans and Corbin challenged Lynch and Rollins for their respective titles in a Last Chance Winner Takes All Mixed tag team match at Extreme Rules, where they failed to win the match after Rollins pinned Corbin, thus ending her feud with Becky Lynch.</p><h2>Who is Lacey Evans Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lacey Evans</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Evans then went on to compete in the first ever 15 woman elimination tag match representing Team Smackdown at the ppv event “Survivor Series” where the first time ever the NXT women’s locker room would also compete in the match. Evans was able to get the elimination over 11x women’s champion and The Captain of Team Raw Charlotte Flair via pin, after her teammate Asuka betrayed her own team and shot poison mist into Flair’s eyes, allowing Evans to take advantage of the situation and allowing her to hit her with her finisher . Shortly after, she was eliminated by Natalya via roll up, who was representing Team Raw, however, Team NXT ultimately won the match when The Captain of Team NXT Rhea Ripley pinned The Captain of Team Smackdown Sasha Banks, making her the final woman standing.
