McDonough has been on television and on radio.&nbsp;McDonough was as a guest on CrossTalk and Russia Today on October 10, 2010 in which he debated how it was possible that the Second World War could have been avoided.&nbsp;He was featured on his BBC 1 documentary A Tale of Two Rival Cities that was one of the elements of the BBC’s “History of the World” project. For the project, he was also the Historical Consultant. The documentary was awarded the Royal Television Society Award.&nbsp;He was interviewed for two special programs that aired on French National Television to commemorate his 70th birthday and the anniversary of de Gaulle’s speech on June 18, 1940 speech, in which he declared that”the “flame of French Resistance cannot be extinguished”.&nbsp;McDonough was featured as a historian on France 2 and also in an extra documentary that featured historians who analyzed de Gaulle’s life, which aired by France 3 on the 18th of June 2010.&nbsp;McDonough was also featured on The BBC 1 programme Inside Out discussing a story told by actor Paul McGann that looked at the possibility that Adolf Hitler visited Liverpool between November 1911 between May 1912 and November 1911.&nbsp;McDonough said that the evidence of Austrian police records, eyewitness reports from Vienna and shipping records all strongly suggested that young Hitler was in Vienna during this time, and not Liverpool which is in line with the claims of Hitler stated in his autobiography Mein Kampf.&nbsp;in 2012 McDonough was featured in a show about the historical background of the Third Reich on National Geographic channel titled Nazi Secrets.&nbsp;McDonough was featured on three different episodes: “Hitler’s Damned Women”, “Hitler’s Family Skeletons” and “Hitler’s Millions”.&nbsp;In November of 2013, McDonough was featured in an BBC 1 documentary called The Story of the Swastika and the Channel 5 documentary called 7 Days that Made the Fuhrer.&nbsp;The year 2014 was the time McDonough was featured in the 10-part documentary series titled The Rise of the Nazi Party on Quest TV, part of the Discovery Channel.</p><p>In his research on Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, published in 1998 McDonough proposed a post-revisionist theory, based upon the work in R. A. C. Parker’s book, Chamberlain and Appeasement and expanded the scope to include appeasement within society, and taking a look at economic appeasement and mass media, and those who oppose appeasement.&nbsp;McDonough acknowledged that appeasement was most likely the only option available to the British government during the 1930s, however unlike the revisionists , he claimed that it was not properly implemented and implemented late and was not enforced effectively enough to deter Hitler.&nbsp;McDonough suggested that appeasement should be examined as a viable policy in the context at which it was implemented and examine the way that Chamberlain’s personality played an important role in the execution and implementation particularly his mistakes of judgment as well as his inability to listen to the opposition and his inability to explore alternative options.&nbsp;McDonough asserts that Chamberlain’s model of appeasement as exemplified by an inflexible politician who was unwilling to change directionuntil circumstances required him to, in fact resulted in Britain and France beginning World War I in 1939 with an inferior strategic position. It also handed the initial advantage gained during the war to Hitler’s government which resulted in Germany had only the one European front until June 1944.</p><p>In McDonough’s 2007 monograph, The Conservative Party and Anglo-German Relations, 1905–1914, published by Palgrave Macmillan, he moved the focus of analysis to the Conservative Party’s role in the outbreak of the First World War. The study was described in a review in the journal The Bulletin of the German Institute of Historical Research by a German foreign policy scholar as “a thorough and thought-provoking analysis, which draws on over thirty archives and provides a powerful and overdue corrective to the traditional depiction of the Edwardian Conservative Party as ‘Scaremongers’ and the chief promoters of Germanophobic views among British political parties in the years that led to the outbreak of the First World War”.</p><p>In 2008, McDonough published The Holocaust, with John Cochrane. This book is a new introduction to both the events and the complex international response to the Holocaust and examines the grim reality of life and death in the death camps, the scholarly debates and the impact on popular culture since 1945 of the most horrific aspect of the history of the 20th century.</p><p align=justify>His other works include: The Origins of the First and Second World Wars (1997); The British Empire, 1815-1914 (1994) and Chamberlain, Hitler as well as Appeasement (2002).&nbsp;in 1998 McDonough received a request from the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations Board to write a set of texts called Fascism, Conflict and Communism: European History: 1890-1945.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frank McDonough</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frank</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>McDonough</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Historian Of The Modern Age</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Liverpool</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Frank McDonough ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
