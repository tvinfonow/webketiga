Who is Ernest Cline dating now & how much money does Ernest Cline have?</p><h2>Ernest Cline Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ernest Cline</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Writer</strong> who was born on <strong>March 29, 1972</strong> in Ashland, Ashland, <strong>United States</strong>. Cline was born and raised in Ashland, Ohio, the son of Faye Imogene (née Williams) and Ernest Christy Cline. As a youth in the 1970s and 1980s, Cline was “addicted to video games and movies,” especially Star Wars, the films of John Hughes, and the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. He worked in information technology in his twenties and worked on screenwriting in his spare time.</p><p>In June 2010, Cline sold his first novel, Ready Player One, a book that takes place in a dystopian vision of the 2040s. The book is about a kid who tries to solve the keys to find a billionaire’s wealth in a sort of competition. The book was sold in a bidding war to the Crown Publishing Group (a division of Random House). The film rights to the novel were sold the following day, to Warner Bros., with Cline co-writing the screenplay. Ten months later, with the hardcover release coinciding with the paperback release, Cline revealed on his blog that both the paperback and hardcover editions of Ready Player One contain an elaborately hidden Easter egg. This clue formed the first part of a series of staged video gaming tests, similar to the plot of the novel. Cline also revealed that the competition’s grand prize would be a 1981 DeLorean. The prize was awarded in 2012. The paperback is currently in its 17th printing.</p><p>Cline’s second novel, Armada, was released on July 14, 2015, by Crown Publishing Group. On December 7, 2015, Cline announced the sale of the film rights to Armada to Universal Pictures for a reported seven-figure sum.</p><p>In 2016, he married poet/nonfiction writer Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz, whom he met at the 1998 National Poetry Slam.</p><p align=justify>In 2001, Cline self-published a chapbook collection of his spoken-word writing, The Importance of Being Ernest, and released an album, The Geek Wants Out. In fall 2013 Write Bloody Publishing published a new edition of The Importance of Being Ernest with new cover art by Gary Musgrave and new interior illustrations by Len Peralta.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ernest Cline</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ernest</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ernest</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Writer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ashland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ashland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ernest Cline ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
