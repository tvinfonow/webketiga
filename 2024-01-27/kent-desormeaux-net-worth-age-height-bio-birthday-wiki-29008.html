Who is Kent Desormeaux dating now & how much money does Kent Desormeaux have?</p><h2>Kent Desormeaux Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kent Desormeaux</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Jockey</strong> who was born on <strong>February 27, 1970</strong> in Maurice, Louisiana, <strong>United States</strong>. He followed this with a victory in the Preakness Stakes. However, Desormeaux lost his bid to win the Triple Crown when Victory Gallop beat Real Quiet by a nose in the final stride in the Belmont Stakes. “It hurts that I’ll live in infamy. Who wants to be known for the closest ever to almost win the Triple Crown?” Later that year, he went on to ride the Canadian 3-year-old champion colt Archers Bay to victory in the Queen’s Plate, becoming the first jockey since Bill Hartack in 1964 to complete the Kentucky Derby/Queen’s Plate double in the same year.</p><p>In 1989 Desormeaux won his third jockey title, and set an American record for most wins in a year with 598; the previous record had been 546. The record still stands. That year, Desormeaux competed in 2,312 races, earning $9.1 million. He also won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey. Desormeaux, became the third jockey to win the Eclipse Award in both the apprentice and overall categories, Chris McCarron and Steve Cauthen being the others.</p><p>In 1990, he moved to the highly competitive southern California circuit. He later explained, “If I wanted to be in the Kentucky Derby or Breeders’ Cup, I had to make a change.” Desormeaux would soon win his first major stakes race, the San Juan Capistrano Invitational, then a Grade 1 race at Santa Anita with a purse of $500,000. Competition for mounts was fierce.</p><p>During the mid-nineties, Desormeaux gradually gained a reputation of not listening to trainers. “There is no doubt that I was on top of the world”, Desormeaux said. “No one needed to tell me how to ride a horse. I became very irresponsible with rides. I was immature in a number of situations. I wasn’t professional. I didn’t pay attention to trainer’s instructions, and I wasn’t persevering to the wire.” He never stopped competing, but his win percentage dropped from 23% in 1992 (364 wins in 1,594 starts) to 17% in 1996 (182 wins in 1,053 starts).</p><p align=justify>His success led him to move north to compete on the Maryland racing circuit, where his winning record earned him the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey in 1987. While racing in Maryland from 1987-89, Desormeaux won more races than any other jockey in North America. He is one of only four jockeys to have won three national titles in a row. In 1987, he had 450 wins from 2,207 starts with earnings of $5.1 million. In 1988, he improved to 474 wins from 1,897 starts and earnings of $6.3 million. He got his first mount in the Kentucky Derby in 1988, finishing 16th.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kent Desormeaux</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hiroyuki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Imai</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jockey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maurice</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>J.

They were about to overtake the leader in the closing stages when Desormeaux sat up on the horse, having misjudged the finish line. Kotashaan’s trainer, Richard Mandella said: “He didn’t stand up for a second and sit down again, he half pulled up.” Kotashaan finished second; the mistake costing roughly $1 million in prize money.</p><h2>Kent Desormeaux Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kent Desormeaux is one of the <strong>richest Jockey</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kent Desormeaux</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Kent Jason Desormeaux (born February 27, 1970) is an American thoroughbred horse racing Hall of Fame jockey who holds the U.S. record for most races won in a single year with 598 wins in 1989. He has won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes three times each, and the Belmont Stakes once. Aboard Real Quiet, he lost the 1998 Triple Crown by a nose.</p><p align=justify>Desormeaux was sixteen years old when he began working as an apprentice jockey at the Evangeline Downs racetrack in Lafayette, Louisiana. On July 13, 1986, he rode Miss Tavern to his first career victory. He won his first career stakes race on December 13 of that year, riding Godbey in the Maryland City Handicap at Laurel Park Racecourse. For 1986, he had 55 wins from 525 starts.</p><p align=justify>As a result of the move, Desormeaux’s number of wins declined to 220 in 1990, a 60% decrease from 1989. His earnings were less affected, totaling $7.1 million in 1990, a 22% decrease from the year before, a result of the higher purses generally available in California. In 1992, Desormeaux would become the regular rider of Best Pal, who put together a string of four graded stakes wins, including the Santa Anita Handicap. He would later call Best Pal his favorite horse to ride. “Best Pal may not have been the fastest horse I ever rode…but what that horse was, was push button.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jockey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite the severity of his injuries, Desormeaux was back riding in six weeks and soon rebounded to his old form. “I think he answered all the questions with [his comeback] rides” said fellow jockey Gary Stevens. “You’ve got to prove yourself all over again to your clients.”” On January 23, Desormeaux would pick up the mount on Kotashaan. They proceeded to win five grade 1 races together, culminating in the 1993 Breeders’ Cup Turf. At the end of the year his peers voted him the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.</p><p>In 1995, Desormeaux, aged 25, became the youngest rider to amass 3,000 victories. That year, he scored his second Breeders’ Cup title when he beat the “boys” in the Breeders’ Cup Sprint with the filly Desert Stormer. In 1997, at age 27, he was the youngest jockey to surpass $100 million in career earnings.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kent Desormeaux height</b> <strong>1.6&nbsp;m</strong> Hiroyuki <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.6&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On December 11, 1992, at Hollywood Park, Desormeaux was thrown when the horse he was riding, Judge Hammer, shied during the stretch drive. He was then kicked in the head by a trailing horse, resulting in multiple skull fractures and a permanent hearing deficit. Prior to the fall, Desormeaux had been on pace to break José A. Santos’ then-current earnings record of $14.8 million. Desormeaux fell just short with earnings of $14.1 million, but still won the national earnings title. He also received his second Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey.</p><p align=justify>In 2000, Desormeaux won his second Kentucky Derby aboard Fusaichi Pegasus. The two combined to take the Wood Memorial Stakes and Jerome Handicap. “Probably the most talented horse I rode (was) Fusaichi Pegasus,” he said in 2004. “What an amazing, amazing, animal that horse was.” In 2001, Desormeaux decided to ride in Japan for three months. His son, Joshua, then age 2, had been born deaf and had recently received a “microphonic implant.” Since Japan only has two racing days a week (compared to six in the United States), the move allowed Desormeaux to spend more time with his family. During this stint, he became the first foreign jockey to win a Classic race in Japan when he rode Lady Pastel to victory in the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks).</p><h2>Who is Kent Desormeaux Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kent Desormeaux</strong> married to <strong>Rosie Higgins , Sonia Desormeaux </strong>.
