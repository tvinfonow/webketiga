His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (née Wiggum; March 23, 1919&nbsp;– April 22, 2013), was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919&nbsp;– March 15, 1996), was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist. Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch (German)-speaking family.</p><p>Matthew Abraham Groening (/ˈ ɡ r eɪ n ɪ ŋ / ( listen ) GRAY -ning; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, and animator.

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Groening grew up in Portland, and attended Ainsworth Elementary School and Lincoln High School. From 1972 to 1977, Groening attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, a liberal arts school that he described as “a hippie college, with no grades or required classes, that drew every weirdo in the Northwest.” He served as the editor of the campus newspaper, The Cooper Point Journal, for which he also wrote articles and drew cartoons. He befriended fellow cartoonist Lynda Barry after discovering that she had written a fan letter to Joseph Heller, one of Groening’s favorite authors, and had received a reply. Groening has credited Barry with being “probably [his] biggest inspiration.” He first became interested in cartoons after watching the Disney animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and he has also cited Robert Crumb, Ernie Bushmiller, Ronald Searle, Monty Python, and Charles M. Schulz as inspirations.</p><h2>Matt Groening Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Matt Groening is one of the <strong>richest Cartoonist</strong> from United States.

He went through what he described as “a series of lousy jobs,” including being an extra in the television movie When Every Day Was the Fourth of July, busing tables, washing dishes at a nursing home, clerking at the Hollywood Licorice Pizza record store, landscaping in a sewage treatment plant, and chauffeuring and ghostwriting for a retired Western director.</p><p>Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book Life in Hell, which was loosely inspired by the chapter “How to Go to Hell” in Walter Kaufmann’s book Critique of Religion and Philosophy. Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde Wet magazine in 1978. The strip, titled “Forbidden Words,” appeared in the September/October issue of that year.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Matt Groening height</b> <strong>5 ft 11 in</strong> Matt <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character’s hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an ‘M’, and the right ear resembled a ‘G’. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a ‘G’ when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. Marge’s distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Bart’s original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and “not thinking that [Bart] would eventually be drawn in color” gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head. Lisa’s physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline. While designing Lisa, Groening “couldn’t be bothered to even think about girls’ hair styles”. When designing Lisa and Maggie, he “just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color”. Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as The Simpsons shorts), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.</p><p align=justify>Groening had gained employment at the Los Angeles Reader, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper. Life in Hell made its official debut as a comic strip in the Reader on April 25, 1980. Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, “Sound Mix,” in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his “various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems” instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he “just made stuff up,” concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week’s column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the “music” column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on The Simpsons.</p><h2>Who is Matt Groening Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Matt Groening</strong> married to <strong>Agustina Picasso (m. 2011), Deborah Caplan (m. 1986–1999)</strong>.

At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons, which has since aired 684 episodes. In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999, running for four years on Fox, then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons. In 2016, Groening developed a new series for Netflix titled Disenchantment, which premiered in August 2018.</p><h2>Top Facts about Matt Groening</h2><li>Creator of “The Simpsons” and “Futurama.”</li><li>Born on February 15, 1954 in Portland, Oregon.</li><li>Graduated from The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.</li><li>Has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards for his work.</li><li>Estimated net worth of $600 million as of 2021.</li><li>Named one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” in 1999.</li><li>Co-founded Bongo Comics with Steve Vance and Cindy Vance in 1993.</li><li>Voiced several characters on “The Simpsons,” including Homer’s neighbor Ned Flanders.</li><li>Created the Netflix animated series “Disenchantment” in 2018.</li><li>Inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2012.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Matt Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Cartoonist</strong>.

Matt Groening celebrates birthday on February 15 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Life in Hell caught the attention of Hollywood writer-producer and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks, who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project, which would turn out to be developing a series of short animated skits, called “bumpers,” for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Groening feared that he would have to give up his ownership rights, and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it. Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks’s office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family: Homer, the overweight father; Marge, the slim mother; Bart, the bratty oldest child; Lisa, the intelligent middle child; and Maggie, the baby. Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Marge (Margaret or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name “Bart,” an anagram of brat. However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons. Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark “is the actual inspiration for Bart.”</p><h3>When did Matt Groening leave The Simpsons?</h3><p>Matt Groening, (born February 15, 1954, Portland, Oregon, U.S.), American cartoonist and animator who created the comic strip Life in Hell (1980–2012) and the television series The Simpsons (<b>1989–</b> ) and Futurama (1999–2003, 2010–13).</p><h3>Is Matt Groening a billionaire?</h3><p>As of 2022, <b>Matt Groening’s net worth is roughly $600 million</b>.
