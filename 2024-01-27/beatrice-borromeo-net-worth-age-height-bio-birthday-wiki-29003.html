Borromeo was the child of Don Carlo Ferdinando Borromeo, the Count of Arona (born in 1935) and his son Vitaliano Borromeo the 2nd prince of Angera and his long-time partner the The Countess Donna Paola Marzotto (born in 1955).&nbsp;Her father is closely related to Carlo Borromeo (1538-1584), who was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop of Milan and was a saint who was canonized.&nbsp;The family is currently the owner of most of the Borromean Islands located in Lago Maggiore, Milan city and a host of other estates spread across the Lombardy and Piedmont countrysides.</p><p>Borromeo worked along with Marco Travaglio and Vauro Senesi for the publication Italia Annozero (Chiarelettere, 2009).</p><p>She also wrote the preface for Birgit Hamer’s Delitto senza castigo: La Vera Storia di Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia.

Borromeo then posted on Twitter: “Vincere una causa e’ sempre piacevole, ma contro Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia la goduria è doppia!” (“Winning a case is always nice, but against Victor Emmanuel of Savoy the pleasure is double”), which resulted in spat on social media with his son Emanuele Filiberto.</p><p>Borromeo directed Mamma Mafia, a documentary about mafia women: its preview was released by the Newsweek Daily Beast Company on 31 January 2013.
