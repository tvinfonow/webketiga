Who is Kim Deal dating now & how much money does Kim Deal have?</p><h2>Kim Deal Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kim Deal</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Bassist</strong> who was born on <strong>June 10, 1961</strong> in Dayton, Ohio, <strong>United States</strong>. Vocalist and bassist who rose to stardom with the alternative rock group The Pixies and who worked as the vocalist and guitarist for The Breeders.</p><p>Nirvana frontman <a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a> was a fan of her work, and called The Breeders’ album Pod one of his favorite releases.</p><p>Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for the Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, “Band seeks bassist into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please&nbsp;– no chops.” Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley’s bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band’s first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque “Mrs. John Murphy” in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband’s name as a form of respect.</p><p>Deal joined Pixies in January 1986, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and the Pixies’ hiatus, she formed the Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs, and Britt Walford. Following the band’s debut album Pod, her twin sister Kelley Deal joined, replacing Tanya Donelly.</p><p align=justify>She married Kevin Murphy in 1985.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kim Deal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Deal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dayton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ann Deal, Ed Deal</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>John Murphy</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kim Deal ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song “Silver” and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album’s recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Deal commented that during the sessions, it “went from just all fun to work”. Exhaustion from releasing three records in two years and constant touring contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal.</p><h2>Kim Deal Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kim Deal is one of the <strong>richest Bassist</strong> from United States.

Although the band went into stasis in 1994 when Kelley Deal entered rehab for a heroin addiction, they never officially split up, and in 2002 released Title TK (TK is a copyediting mark meaning “to come” and is often used when editing drafts to indicate missing information).</p><p>Deal returned to the U.S. after finishing recording Pod in Edinburgh, but was then fired from the Pixies. Regardless, she flew out to Los Angeles to meet with the band and the other members changed their mind and the four of them began recording the band’s next album, Bossanova (1990).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kim Deal height</b> <strong>5 feet 5 inches</strong> Kim <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 5 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During a 1988 post-Surfer Rosa tour of Europe with Throwing Muses as part of the Pixies, Deal began to write new material. As both bands did not have plans for the short term, Deal discussed possible side-projects with Throwing Muses guitarist Tanya Donnelly. After rejecting the idea of creating a dance album together, the pair decided to form a new band. Deal named the band the Breeders, after the folk band she formed with Kelley as a teenager, and they recruited Carrie Bradley, violinist and vocalist in Ed’s Redeeming Qualities, to record a short demo tape.</p><p align=justify>Deal has contributed her voice to numerous projects, including This Mortal Coil’s 1991 version of Chris Bell’s “You and Your Sister” (a duet with Tanya Donnelly); the 1995 Sonic Youth single “Little Trouble Girl”; and The For Carnation’s “Tales (Live from the Crypt)” in 2000.</p><h2>Who is Kim Deal Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kim Deal</strong> married to <strong>John Murphy </strong>.
