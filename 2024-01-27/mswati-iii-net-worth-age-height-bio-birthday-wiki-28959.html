Mswati III, born Makhosetive on 19 April 1968, is the king (Swazi : Ngwenyama yemaSwati ) of Eswatini. He also heads the Swazi Royal Family.&nbsp;He was born in Manzini, Protectorate Swaziland to King Sobhuza III and Ntfombi Tfwala, one of his younger wives.&nbsp;At the age of 18 he was crowned Mswati III Ingwenyama, King of Swaziland. He became the youngest reigning monarch in the history of the world.&nbsp;He is an absolute monarch and shares the throne with Ntfombi Tfwala his mother.&nbsp;Mswati III is well-known for his polygamy. Although at least two wives are appointed to him by the state, he currently has fifteen wives.&nbsp;His extravagant lifestyle and policies have been the subject of protests in local areas and international criticism.</p><p>Although he has been accused of kidnapping women that he wants to marry, no charges can be filed against him.&nbsp;He also allegedly called for a meeting of parliament to discuss whether HIV-positive persons should be “sterilized” and “branded” in 2000.</p><p>According to accusations by Amnesty International, Zena Mahlangu, an 18-year-old high school student, disappeared from her school in October 2002. Her mother, Lindiwe Dlamini, learned that her daughter had been taken by two men, Qethuka Sgombeni Dlamini and Tulujani Sikhondze, and she reported the matter to the police. Some time later, she was told that her daughter was at Ludzidzini Royal Village and was being prepared to be the next wife of the king. She demanded that her daughter be returned to her custody, and threatened to sue.</p><p>In 2004, Mswati promulgated a new constitution that allows freedom of speech and assembly for the media and public, while retaining the traditional Tinkhundla system. Amnesty International has criticized the new constitution as inadequate in some respects.</p><p align=justify>Mswati was appointed Crown Prince in September 1983. He was crowned king the following day, 25 April 1986. At 18 years old, he is the youngest reigning monarch.&nbsp;His mother is Indlovukati (“Great Shee-Elephant”) and they rule together.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mswati III</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mswati</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>III</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sovereign</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Manzini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Eswatini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sobhuza II, Ntfombi of Eswatini</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Queen Mantfombi Dlamini, Princess Lindiwe Dlamini, MORE</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Zena Mahlangu</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sikhanyiso Dlamini, Lindaninkosi Dlamini, MORE</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mswati III ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

However, critics such as the People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO) believe that these changes are solely aimed at strengthening and perpetuating the traditional order. His attendance at the May 2012 Sovereign Monarchs lunch, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, caused some controversy, given criticisms of his regime’s human rights record.</p><h2>Mswati III Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mswati III is one of the <strong>richest Sovereign</strong> from Eswatini. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mswati III</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>The 14-year-old Makhosetive was chosen by the Great Council of State (the Liqoqo), to become the next king after King Sobhuza II’s death on 21 August 1982.&nbsp;Two of Sobhuza’s wives, Queen Dzeliwe Shongwe (1982-1983), and Queen NtfombiTfwala (1983-1986) served as regents while he studied in the United Kingdom at Sherborne School (International College). He was then called back to the throne.</p><p align=justify>Makhosetive was a young prince who attended Masundwini Primary School, and then Lozitha Palace School.&nbsp;In December 1982, he took the Swaziland Primary Certificate Examination at Phondo Royal Residence. He received First Class with merit for English and Mathematics.&nbsp;He became interested in the royal guard and was the first young cadet of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force.</p><p align=justify>In an attempt to mitigate the HIV and AIDS pandemic in 2001, the king used his traditional powers to invoke a time-honoured chastity rite (umcwasho) under the patronage of a princess, which encouraged all Swazi maidens to abstain from sexual relations for five years. This was last done under Sobhuza II in 1971. This rite banned sexual relations for Swazis under 18 years of age from 9 September 2001 and 19 August 2005, but just two months after imposing the ban, he violated this decree when a 17-year-old liphovela (royal fiancée) was chosen, who became his 13th wife. As per custom, he was fined a cow by members of her regiment, which he duly paid.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sovereign</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mswati has been criticized for his lavish lifestyle, especially by the media; in one report he was accused of living a luxurious lifestyle while the people of his country starve. In the 2014 national budget, parliament allocated $61 million (US) for the King’s annual household budget, while 63% of Swazis live on less than $1.25 per day. Following criticism of his purchase of luxury cars, including a $500,000 DaimlerChrysler’s flagship Maybach 62 luxury automobile, he banned the photography of his vehicles. According to the Forbes 2009 list of the World’s 15 Richest Royals, King Mswati is worth a reported $200 million. In January 2004 the Times of Swaziland reported that the king asked his government to spend about $15-million to redecorate three main palaces and build others for each of his 11 wives. The Prime Minister’s Office issued a press statement saying the article in the Times of Swaziland was “reckless and untrue” and that the proposal was for the construction of 5 State Houses, not Palaces, and the cost was only €19.9 million. Later that year the go-ahead was given to build five new buildings at a cost of more than $4-million out of public funds. In August 2008, Swazi scouts marched through the capital protesting the cost of a shopping spree taken abroad by nine of the King’s thirteen wives. The demonstration was organized by Positive Living, a non-governmental organization for Swazi women living with AIDS.</p><p>On 19&nbsp;April 2018, King Mswati III changed the name of the country to Eswatini. The change was to mark the country’s 50th anniversary of independence. 19 April is actually the king’s birthday, though the actual anniversary was indeed 6 September of that same year. Mswati III wanted the name Eswatini which is the ancient original name for the country and this change was to give up the previous colonial name Swaziland.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mswati III height</b> Not available right now.

The matter went to the High Court, but Swaziland’s Attorney-General Phesheya Dlamini intervened. She has since had two children, and formally became the king’s wife in 2010.</p><p align=justify>In April 2020, he was reported to have been admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties, and, as of 13 April, to be in a critical condition.
