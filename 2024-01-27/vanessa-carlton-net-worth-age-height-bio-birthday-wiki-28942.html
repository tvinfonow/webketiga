Musician, singer-songwriter, and musician whose smash song “A Thousand Miles” was in the top five spots of the year 2002’s Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Album Rabbits on the Run is an homage to her Book Watership Down, as well as A Brief History of Time, written by&nbsp;Her album Rabbits on the Run is inspired by the book Watership Down, as well as A Brief History of Time, which was written by <a href=#>Stephen Hawking</a>…</p><p>Her interest in music began at an early age. At the age of 2, she visited Disneyland Park and played “It’s a Small World” on the piano when she came home. Her mother then began to tutor her. She was introduced to classical music from a young age. By the age of 9, she had become passionate about ballet. In 1994, when Carlton was 14 years old, she enrolled at the School of American Ballet. Upon graduation, she put on vocal performances at nightclubs in the community, beginning to feel more comfortable and dynamic on the stage. Carlton was signed to A&M Records in 2001.</p><p>With her previous unsuccessful recording efforts, Carlton felt there was a lack of direction at her label. However, A&M president Ron Fair upon hearing her demo to “A Thousand Miles”, began organizing recording sessions for the song, producing and arranging the song himself. It became a hit, peaking inside the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 and went on to become the sixth-most-played song of the year, as well as garnering Grammy Award nominations for “Record of the Year”, “Song of the Year”, and “Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)”. Fair would produce the rest of the album. Be Not Nobody was subsequently released in April 2002 and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart with 102,000 units sold. It went on to sell more than two million copies worldwide. Two more singles, “Ordinary Day” and “Pretty Baby” were released. Carlton began touring in support of her debut album, opening for the Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind, before headlining her own tour at the end of 2002.

Harmonium debuted at number 33 on the Billboard 200 and descended quickly after, selling fewer than 150,000 copies as of February 2006, which was considered a disappointment after her successful debut. It was produced by Stephan Jenkins from rock band Third Eye Blind, and included darker themes than those on her debut album. Carlton and Jenkins met and began a relationship in mid-2002, when she and Third Eye Blind, of which Jenkins is lead singer, were on tour together. After seeing Carlton perform live, Jenkins entered her dressing room and expressed interest in producing her music, and according to Carlton they “decided very quickly, that we had the same vision for the album”. Carlton credited Jenkins with helping her to withstand and protect herself from pressures the record label executives, who wanted to influence the recording process, placed on her. According to Carlton, her label “wasn’t very happy” about the decisions she made during the making of the album.</p><h2>Vanessa Carlton Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Vanessa Carlton is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

It created this kinetic environment that was kind of like Fleetwood Mac.

A single, “White Houses”, released to radio in late August 2004, peaking at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. MTV censored and later banned the single’s music video because of a controversial lyric in the song that refers to sexual intercourse.

A second tour, with Cary Brothers and Ari Hest as supporting acts, ran from March 9 to April 30. Carlton left A&M Records in mid-2005 as she felt that her nonconformist attitude would have created problems for her at the label in the future. A&M Records had sent Carlton into the recording studio because they wanted to re-release Harmonium, whereas Carlton felt the album should be promoted as it was. During her studio time, in which she wrote songs with Linda Perry and The Matrix, she had what she called a “revelation” about leaving the label to find another record deal once promotion for Harmonium had ended. In the same period she collaborated with the Italian singer Zucchero Fornaciari featuring his song Indaco Dagli Occhi Del Cielo (cover of the well known Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime), together with the violinist Haylie Ecker, in the album Zu & Co.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Vanessa Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Pop Singer</strong>.
