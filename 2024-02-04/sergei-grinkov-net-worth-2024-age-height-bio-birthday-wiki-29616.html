They also completed the difficult maneuver at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov’s boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules, they were disqualified from that event (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating).</p><p align=justify>On 20 November 1995, Grinkov collapsed and died from a massive heart attack in Lake Placid, New York, while he and Gordeeva were practicing for the upcoming 1995–1996 Stars on Ice tour. Doctors found that Grinkov had severely clogged coronary arteries (to the point where his arterial opening was reportedly the size of a pinhole), which caused the heart attack; later testing revealed that he also had a genetic risk factor linked with premature heart attacks. The risk factor is called the PLA-2 variant and is also known as the “Grinkov Risk Factor.” Grinkov was 28 years old. His wife was 24 and their daughter was 3 years old.</p><h2>Who is Sergei Grinkov Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sergei Grinkov</strong> married to <strong>Ekaterina Gordeeva </strong>.
