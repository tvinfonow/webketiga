Who is Styles P dating now & how much money does Styles P have?</p><h2>Styles P Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Styles P</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>November 28, 1974</strong> in Corona, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>David Styles (born November 28, 1974), better known by his stage name Styles P or simply Styles, is an American rapper, best known as a member of hip hop group The Lox, alongside his childhood friends Sheek Louch and Jadakiss. Along with the other members of The Lox, he is a founder of D-Block Records and is also a part of the Ruff Ryders. In addition to his group work he has released multiple albums and mixtapes as a solo MC. In 2002 he released his debut solo album A Gangster and a Gentleman, which contained the hit single “Good Times”. The song peaked at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and received massive nationwide airplay in 2002.</p><p>As a trio, The Lox began rapping in the mid-1990s and started to build a steady underground following thanks to their performances and street freestyles. In their late teens, the trio met Mary J. Blige who was impressed with their lyrical content, and gave their demo to Sean “Diddy” Combs. Diddy immediately hired the trio to write for Bad Boy Records. After signing with Bad Boy, the Lox quickly started collaborating on hits with Diddy, The Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige and Mariah Carey which gave them instant notoriety and status within the hip-hop and mainstream charts. In 1996 and 1997, the group wrote and performed on a number of Diddy hits, including “It’s All About the Benjamins” and “I Got the Power”, Mase’s “24 Hrs. to Live”, Mariah Carey’s “Honey”, the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Last Day” and Mary J. Blige’s “Can’t Get You Off My Mind”. In 1997, the Lox received international acclaim when their tribute to the late Biggie Smalls, “We’ll Always Love Big Poppa”, was picked as the B-side track from Diddy’s No Way Out album (3x Platinum) with the number one hit, “I’ll Be Missing You”. This single was the most played hit in 1997, which opened the door for the Lox’s to write more of their own songs and eventually release their first album in January 1998 titled Money, Power & Respect. The album went on to be certified platinum, and, although the album was a chart-topping success, the group grew to feel that the glossy image and production style of Bad Boy Records conflicted with their grimier rap aesthetic. After trying and failing to get Puff Daddy to grant them a release from their contract, the group confronted him in his office, with Styles P throwing a chair at his own boss. After this, the group was granted their release and left Bad Boy to sign with Ruff Ryder Records.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Styles P</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Killian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Overmeire</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Corona</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Adjua Styles</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tai Styles, Noah Styles</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Styles P ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
