He also retired as the all-time leading scorer for both teams.</p><p>After&nbsp;Jan Steenerud&nbsp;he became the second placekicker to be inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>Andersen had stated that his goal was to be the first NFL player to play until he turned 50 in 2010. However, he retired just two days after he would have become the oldest player ever to appear in an NFL game, if he had played for a team at the time. The record held by George Blanda still stands – Blanda played in his last NFL game on January 4, 1976 (the 1975 AFC Championship) at the age of 48&nbsp;years, 109&nbsp;days.</p><p>Andersen was born in Copenhagen and raised in the west Jutland town of Struer, Denmark.

On his first NFL kickoff to start the strike-shortened 1982 season, Andersen twisted his ankle and missed eight weeks of the season. Despite the early setback, he soon emerged as one of the strongest and most reliable placekickers in the NFL. In his years with the Saints, he was named to six Pro Bowls, kicked 302 field goals, and scored 1318 points. In 1991, against Chicago, Andersen kicked a 60-yard field goal, tying him with Steve Cox for the second-longest field goal in league history at the time, behind 63-yard record-holder kicked by Tom Dempsey and Graham Gano. (Andersen’s kick has since been matched by Rob Bironas, Dan Carpenter and Greg Zuerlein, and surpassed by Sebastian Janikowski (twice), Jason Elam, Justin Tucker, Jay Feely, Matt Bryant, David Akers, Matt Prater, Jake Elliott, and Stephen Gostkowski.) Andersen’s proficiency with field goal kicking earned him the nickname “Mr. Automatic.” Following the 1994 season, he was released by the Saints for salary cap purposes and because his accuracy had started to decline.</p><h2>Morten Andersen Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Morten Andersen is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from Denmark.
