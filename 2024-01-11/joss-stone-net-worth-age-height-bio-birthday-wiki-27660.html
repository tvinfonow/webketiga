She is the third of four children born to Wendy (née Skillin) and Richard Stoker. Her father owns a fruit and nut import–export business; her mother worked as Stone’s manager until October 2004. Stone made her first public appearance at the Uffculme Comprehensive School—which she attended—in Uffculme, Devon, with a cover version of Jackie Wilson’s 1957 song “Reet Petite”. Stone has dyslexia and left school at age sixteen with only three GCSE qualifications. “It wasn’t that I was stupid. I’m just a little bit dyslexic and I wasn’t very academic. I’m more artistic”, she says.</p><p>Joscelyn Eve Stoker (born 11 April 1987), better known by her stage name Joss Stone, is an English singer, songwriter, and actress. She rose to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist. Her second album, the similarly multi-platinum Mind Body & Soul (2004), topped the UK Albums Chart for one week and spawned the top ten hit “You Had Me”, Stone’s most successful single on the UK Singles Chart to date. Both the album and single received one nomination at the 2005 Grammy Awards, while Stone herself was nominated for Best New Artist, and in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2004, was ranked fifth as a predicted breakthrough act of 2004. She became the youngest British female singer to top the UK Albums Chart. Stone’s third album, Introducing Joss Stone, released in March 2007, achieved gold record status by the RIAA and yielded the second-ever highest debut for a British female solo artist on the Billboard 200, and became Stone’s first top five album in the US.</p><p align=justify>Her parents were Richard as well as Wendy Stoker.&nbsp;Three of them are siblings: Daniel, Lucy, and Harry.&nbsp;Her along with their boyfriend Cody are expecting their first child .</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joss Stone</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joss</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stone</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soul Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1987</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dover</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Richard Stoker, Wendy Stoker</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lucy Stoker, Daniel Stoker, Harry Stoker</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Joss Stone ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Stone flew to Miami and Philadelphia to start work on her debut album, The Soul Sessions, released on 16 September 2003. She collaborated with people with solid credentials in the Miami soul scene such as Betty Wright, Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas and Little Beaver as well as contemporary acts Angie Stone and the Roots. The album, produced by Steve Greenberg, Mike Mangini and Betty Wright, consists of little-known soul tracks by Franklin, Laura Lee, Bettye Swann and others. Released in late 2003, it reached the top five on the UK Albums Chart as well as the top forty of the US Billboard 200 chart. The lead single, “Fell in Love with a Boy”, a reworking of the White Stripes’ 2001 “Fell in Love with a Girl”, reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, as did the second single, a cover version of Sugar Billy’s 1974 song “Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin’ on Me)”. The album eventually went triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in mid-April 2005 and gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 2004.</p><h2>Joss Stone Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Joss Stone is one of the <strong>richest Soul Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Joss Stone</b>'s net worth <strong>$8 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was dyslexic, which caused her to perform poorly at school.&nbsp;She auditioned for a role on the show that telecasts competitions Star For a Night when she was 13 years old.</p><p align=justify>She began the Total World Tour in April of 2014, with plans to perform a concert across every country on earth.</p><p align=justify>Stone grew up listening to a wide variety of music including 1960s and 1970s American R&B and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. “My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, ‘Oh yeah, that looks really good’, so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, ‘Can I have that for Christmas?’ So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved.” She would later tell MTV News: “I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You’ve got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soul Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2004, Stone began dating Beau Dozier, with whom she co-wrote the song “Spoiled”. Dozier is the son of Motown producer Lamont Dozier, who is best known as part of Holland-Dozier-Holland. The couple ended their relationship in November 2005.</p><p>In April 2004, Stone performed alongside Cam Noble during the VH1’s benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Jessica Simpson and Patti LaBelle, in support of the Save the Music Foundation. Stone joined Band Aid 20 on 14 November 2004 in benefit of Sudan’s troubled Darfur region. The group, consisting of such luminaries as Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and U2 lead singer Bono, re-recorded the 1984 song “Do They Know It’s Christmas?”, written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Stone, who was born two years after the release of the original single, was not initially aware of who Bob Geldof was. The media gleefully reported that she repeatedly referred to him as Bob Gandalf. Despite some criticism, the single became the UK’s biggest-selling single of 2004 as well as the 2004 Christmas number-one single. At the 2005 BRIT Awards, Stone won for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act—entering the Guinness World Records as the youngest BRIT Award solo winner at age seventeen, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act. She also received a nomination for Best UK Act of the Year at the 2005 MOBO Awards, as well as three nominations for the 2005 Grammy Awards—Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “You Had Me”, and Best Pop Vocal Album for Mind Body & Soul, where she sang with rock performer Melissa Etheridge, in tribute to blues-rock singer Janis Joplin. Their performance of “Cry Baby/Piece of My Heart” was released as a single, and through the aid of strong digital download sales, became Stone’s first single to enter the US Billboard Hot 100, when it debuted and peaked at No. 32 the week of 2 April 2005. That same year, she was voted the World’s Sexiest Vegetarian by peta2, alongside Chris Martin.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Joss Stone height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Joss <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2001, at the age of thirteen, Stone auditioned for the BBC Television talent show, Star for a Night in London, singing Franklin’s 1968 Goffin-King hit “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” and Whitney Houston’s 1999 single, “It’s Not Right but It’s Okay”. After passing her audition, she sang Donna Summer’s “On the Radio” for the broadcast, and eventually won the contest. She also appeared on and won Steps to the Stars (a TV programme hosted by H & Claire of the group Steps). Stone then performed on a charity show, where she drew the attention of the Boilerhouse Boys, composed of London-based producers Andy Dean and Ben Wolfe, who contacted S-Curve Records founder and CEO, Steve Greenberg in December 2001 telling him that “they had just heard the greatest singer they’d ever heard from their country.” In early 2002, Greenberg flew Stone to New York for an audition, in which she sang to backing tracks of classic soul songs: Otis Redding’s 1968 “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay”, Gladys Knight & the Pips’ 1973 “Midnight Train to Georgia”, and Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman”; Greenberg instantly signed her to his label.</p><p align=justify>Stone performed a medley of “It’s a Man’s World” and “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” with James Brown on BBC One’s chat show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 1 July 2005. Stone collaborated with jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and blues singer-guitarist Jonny Lang on a cover of U2’s 1988 song “When Love Comes to Town” for Hancock’s 2005 album Possibilities. That same year, Stone was featured along with Sean Paul on Santana’s “Cry Baby Cry”, and worked on a remake of Patti LaBelle’s 1985 song “Stir It Up” for the soundtrack to the Disney animated film Chicken Little. She also collaborated with Lemar in 2006 on his third studio album, The Truth About Love, on the track “Anniversary”. On 5 February 2006, Stone joined Stevie Wonder, India.Arie, and John Legend during the Super Bowl XL pre-game ceremonies to perform a medley of Wonder’s hits. Three days later, on 8 February, on the night of the 2006 Grammy Awards, she helped perform a medley of Sly & the Family Stone’s hits alongside Legend, Ciara, Maroon 5, will.i.am, Robert Randolph, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. Stone made her film debut in the fantasy adventure film Eragon (based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Christopher Paolini), directed by Stefen Fangmeier and released on 15 December 2006, playing the fortune teller Angela. At the 2007 Grammy Awards, Stone shared the award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for her collaboration with John Legend and Van Hunt on their 2005 cover of Sly & the Family Stone’s 1971 chart-topper “Family Affair”.</p><h2>Who is Joss Stone Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Joss Stone</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Stone also appeared in one of Gap’s Fall 2005 “Favorites” commercials, singing the Beach Boys’ 1966 song “God Only Knows”. By that time, rumours circulated about her being dropped from the campaign because she was living with then-25-year-old songwriter and producer Beau Dozier (son of Motown producer and composer Lamont Dozier) in Los Angeles while she was only 17. However, Gap later denied the rumours, stating that they were very happy with Stone and telling BBC Radio 1 that the claims were “absolute tosh” and “a complete fabrication”.
