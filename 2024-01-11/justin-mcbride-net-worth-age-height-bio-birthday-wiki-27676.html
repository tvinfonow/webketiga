He put himself into a tight two-man race between himself and Chris Shivers for the world title that year, winning two Built Ford Tough Series events in the process (Anaheim, California and St. Louis, Missouri). McBride was in the lead for the world title going into the Grand Rapids, Michigan Built Ford Tough series, but unfortunately, disaster struck. He was stepped on by a bull named Mission Pack in the short-go of that event, breaking two ribs and puncturing a lung. Many thought McBride would not make it to the finals, but he did go. He won the first go-round and very nearly took the title away from Shivers, but when McBride bucked off of Mossy Oak Mudslinger in the short-go of the finals, Shivers was awarded the PBR World title and the first ever million-dollar bonus that was awarded to a world champion. McBride finished 2nd overall in 2003 with $281,606 in earnings.</p><p>In 2004, McBride picked up where he left off and won 4 events that year. His main rivals for the world title that year were Adriano Moraes and Mike Lee. He stayed in 2nd place for most of the year, but due to a new points system implemented for the Finals that year, it would be possible for him to catch the leader (who at that point was Adriano, who had a 1,800-point lead heading into the finals). However, for the second year in a row, disaster struck again for McBride in Grand Rapids. This time, in that event’s Mossy Oak Shootout, the bull named Lefty stepped on his right ankle as he was bucked off, breaking it. McBride would need surgery and again, people thought he would not make it to the finals. He did, three weeks later, and turned in some heroic performances early on. Unfortunately, he bucked off his last few bulls and ended up 4th in the world overall that year. He made $303,928 in 2004. Lee would go on to win the PBR world championship that year in a historic come-from-behind performance.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Justin McBride height</b> Not available right now.

Unfortunately for McBride, he faltered at the finals (as did Murray) and the Brazilian, Moraes, ended up winning his second world title that year. McBride finished third in the world that year, winning $302,217 for his efforts.</p><p align=justify>With the monkey off his back, McBride decided he’d have fun in 2006. He maintained a consistent riding average and had several top finishes. In the middle of the year he took time off to spend with his wife, Jill, who gave birth to their new daughter, Addisen Claire McBride. McBride took six events off, but when he came back, he was still in the mix for a world title. He won 3 BFTS events upon his return (and in 2 events rode 2 previously-unridden bulls in the short-go rounds), but the Finals did not go as well as he had hoped. He still earned $232,757 that year and finished 6th overall.</p><h2>Who is Justin McBride Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Justin McBride</strong> married to <strong>Jill McBride</strong>.

He won 6 Built Ford Tough series events, tying a record originally set by Cody Hart in 1999 (the same year Hart won his PBR world title). In the middle of the year he found himself in a heated race for the PBR World Title with Brazilian rider Guilherme Marchi. The two battled it out at the PBR World Finals, and the short-go actually came down to Marchi and McBride. The pressure was on McBride after Marchi successfully made the whistle on the bull Kid Rock. McBride answered by hanging for dear life to the bull Camo, off the side for much of the ride, but nevertheless rode the bull successfully. McBride had overcome adversity and finally won his first-ever PBR World Title in 2005, with over $1.5 million in earnings for the year, a PBR record. His final ride was on a bull named Camo (oddly, McBride would win the title in 2007 on that same bull), and the ride was notable for the fact that McBride spent most of the needed eight seconds literally hanging off the side of the bull.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Justin Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Bull Rider</strong>.
