Burns, who was based in the United States at the time, was asked to audition for the part in early 2014. After securing the role, Burns relocated back to Australia. Of his casting, he said: “When you score a role on a show as iconic as Neighbours, you don’t say no. It’s especially cool to be joining the show in its 30th–anniversary year. I feel like I’ve arrived at the perfect time.” Burns had previously met McGregor through their modelling agency and believed that they had developed a “brotherly spark” through that connection, which he felt helped him secure the role. He also believed the role was meant to be his as his young nephew also shares the name Tyler. Burns made his screen debut as Tyler on 6 February 2015. Burns’ partner, Emma Lane, portrayed Courtney Grixti from 2015 to 2018, a recurring character in the series. The two characters were romantically linked during the series’ 32nd season.
