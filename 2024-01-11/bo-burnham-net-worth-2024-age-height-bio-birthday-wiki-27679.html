Of the controversy, he said, “It’s so ironic because gay bashers were the ones labeling me in high school … I try and write satire that’s well-intentioned. But those intentions have to be hidden. It can’t be completely clear and that’s what makes it comedy.” Despite the college’s admission that they had booked Burnham while ignorant of his show’s material, dean of students John Comerford praised the opportunities for discourse the controversy brought the school.</p><p>At the 2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he was nominated for the main Edinburgh Comedy Award and won both the Edinburgh Comedy Awards’ panel prize and the Malcolm Hardee “Act Most Likely to Make a Million Quid” Award.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bo Burnham height</b> <strong>6 ft 5 in</strong> Bo <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 5 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While performing at the Montreal Just for Laughs festival in 2008, Burnham met with director and producer Judd Apatow. That September, Burnham negotiated with Universal Pictures to write and create the music for an Apatow-produced comedy film which he describes as the “anti-High School Musical”, although Burnham insists the script is not a parody of the Disney musicals, but an attempt to emulate the high school he attended. Hoping to star in the film he was writing, Burnham told Wired magazine that he named the star “Bo” in a “not-so-subtle hint [he] want[s] to be in it”. In a March 2009 interview with Boston’s Weekly Dig, Burnham elaborated on his work with the film. When he is not performing, Burnham spends eight hours a day writing the music, and his nights writing the script, of which he has finished the first draft. Co-writing the screenplay with Burnham was his high school friend Luke Liacos. In an October 2010 interview with MTV, Burnham admitted that he did not know anything about the future of the project, and that it was all effectively up in the air as far as he knew. In May 2009, viral marketing began appearing for Funny People, in which Burnham stars in an NBC sitcom called Yo Teach! In the promo, Burnham stars opposite Jason Schwartzman, as a student in the latter’s English class.</p><p align=justify>Burnham has performed his music in the United States, including Cobb’s Comedy Club, YouTube Live in San Francisco, and Caroline’s Comedy Club in New York City, and internationally in London and Montreal.
