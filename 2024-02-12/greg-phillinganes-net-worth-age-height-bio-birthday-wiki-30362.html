The Boston Globe reviewer Richard Cromonic noted that Stevie Wonder’s influence on the album’s sound is pronounced, and praised the creativity of the compositions. He criticized the lyrics as being less creative, and said that Significant Gains might be too close to Wonder’s sound, calling it “blatant emulation”. While the album itself was not very successful, the song “Baby, I Do Love You” was a minor R&B hit. Three years later, Phillinganes released his follow-up album Pulse, which featured another minor hit (and perhaps his best-known solo hit), a cover of Yellow Magic Orchestra’s song “Behind the Mask” (with additional lyrics written by Michael Jackson). This single was more successful on the dance music charts. When he later joined Eric Clapton’s backing band, Phillinganes introduced the tune to Clapton, who covered it on his 1986 August album. Amidst his solo recordings and touring with Clapton throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s, he became well known as a prominent session musician for a multitude of different artists, performing on many hit albums of the time.

He contributed to every one of Michael Jackson’s solo albums, and cites the title track from 1982’s Thriller as a classic example of his work. In an interview with Atlanta, Phillinganes recalled, “I did the synth bass part, those high-pitched synth parts, I did the Rhodes [keyboard] part and even did the pipe organ that Vincent Price does his rap over. It was crazy! When I listen to it now, I just think about all the fun we had creating all those layers in the studio.” Although paid as a session musician for his contributions to Thriller, the best-selling album of all time, Phillinganes noted that he and the other participating musicians do not receive royalties.
