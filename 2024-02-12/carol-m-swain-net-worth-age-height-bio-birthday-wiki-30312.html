Swain have?</p><h2>Carol M. Swain Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Carol M. Swain</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Political Scientist</strong> who was born on <strong>March 7, 1954</strong> in Bedford, Virginia, <strong>United States</strong>. Carol Miller Swain, the youngest of twelve children, was born in Bedford, Virginia on March 7, 1954.&nbsp;Her mother and father both dropped out of school in third grade, while her mother was unable to finish high school.&nbsp;Her stepfather used physical abuse on Dorothy Henderson, her mother with infantile paralysis.&nbsp;Swain was raised in poverty in a shack with no running water and shared two beds with her 11 siblings.&nbsp;She was the second child of twelve. Swain didn’t have shoes, so she missed school when it snowed.&nbsp;She dropped out of ninth grade and did not complete high school.&nbsp;In the 1960s, she moved to Roanoke to live with her family. She appealed to a judge for a transfer to a foster care home.&nbsp;Swain lived in a trailer park with her grandmother.</p><p>In 1993, Harvard University Press published her first academic book, Black Faces and Black Interests: The Representation Of African Americans in Congress.&nbsp;Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy, both Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, cited the book.&nbsp;It won the D.B.&nbsp;It was the recipient of the D.B.</p><p>Swain received tenure as an associate professor of politics and public policy at Princeton University. From 1999 to 2017, she taught political science and law at Vanderbilt University. She retired from her post at Vanderbilt in 2017.</p><p>In 2002, Swain argued against reparations for American descendants of African slaves during an event at Delaware State University, a historically black university. However, in 2005, she wrote an op ed in The Washington Post calling for the George W. Bush to offer a formal apology to American citizens of African descent for the institution of slavery. She also wrote a policy document about it for the Heartland Institute. When the apology happened in June 2009, during the presidency of Barack Obama, she called it “meaningless.” She expressed disappointment that it did not happen under President George W. Bush, when the Republicans were in power, arguing that “It would have shed that racist scab on the party.”</p><p align=justify>Swain divorced in 1975. She earned a GED, worked as a cashier for McDonald’s, a salesperson at the door, and as an assistant at a retirement home.&nbsp;Virginia Western Community College gave her an associate’s degree.&nbsp;She earned a magnacum laude B.A.&nbsp;She earned a B.A. in criminal justice at Roanoke College, and a master’s in political science at Virginia Tech.&nbsp;As an undergraduate at Roanoke College she established a scholarship fund to support black students. It had an endowment in 2002 of $350,000.&nbsp;In 1989, she received her Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in political science.&nbsp;She received a Master in Legal Studies degree from Yale Law School in 2000.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carol M.

It was reviewed in Rhetoric and Public Affairs and The Journal of Southern History. The book contains telephone interviews with ten people active in the white nationalist movement; the interviews were edited by the interviewees, and Stephanie Shanks-Meile, reviewing the book for Contemporary Sociology, criticized the methodology of the book (“the primary data analysis is weak”) and the lack of interviews with rank-and-file members: “there is still no real substitution for field research, making Swain and Nieli’s ten telephone interviews with ‘leaders’ too superficial to base an entire study on white nationalism”.</p><h2>Carol M.

In the foreword, she says, “[I] have reserved for myself the right to explore hunches and draw upon personal intuitions as I interpret and evaluate data”, a methodology criticized by political scientist Marc Q. Sawyer, who comments, “While I laud this break with convention, frequently these hunches either lead to faulty conclusions or foreclose the opportunity for consideration of alternative explanations in this work. One can disagree with Swain’s normative vision, but when that vision triumphs over social scientific evidence and fails to live up to its claims for social justice, it is legitimate to critique that vision itself”. Sawyer contends Swain ignores important African-American institutions and the variety in thought among African-American scholars, that she misses and misinterprets statistical information, and that, in the end, “despite claims of a normative focus, Swain is largely on the side of the white nationalists”, apologizing for “racist beliefs and practices”.</p><p align=justify>Between October 2012 and July 2014, she was the host of Be the People, a weekly television talk which used paid programming time to air on Sundays on WSMV-TV and WZTV in the Nashville area.</p><h2>Who is Carol M.
