Olha Lyakhova was the pace setter, taking the field through the first two laps (measured at the finish line, not the quarter-mile splits) in 64.26 and 63.94 (2:08.20). As is typical for Hassan, she was last off the start line, but over the next 150 metres, slowly eased herself around the field on the outside into the marking position behind Lyakhova. Gabriela DeBues-Stafford soon moved through the field in between Hassan and Lyakhova for the next lap before Hassan and Gudaf Tsegay separated from the field as the only chasers. Between 800 and 1000 metres, Lyakhova strained to keep on pace, but Hassan and Tsegay were moving forward. After Lyakhova dropped out, they were all alone, 15 metres up on the pack. At the bell, Hassan was looking back at her close chaser Tsegay at 3:10.13 (a 61.93 lap). Hassan accelerated, making a 5-metre break over the next 100 metres. Continuing at this pace, she passed 1500 metres at about 3:55. Hassan finished her final lap in 62.20, her final time of 4:12:33 breaking Svetlana Masterkova’s almost 23-year-old world record. The athletes trailing Hassan rewrote the all-time top 25 list, with Laura Weightman moving into position #15, DeBues-Stafford into #17, and after #5 all-time Tsegay faded into the pack she was followed by Rababe Arafi, Axumawit Embaye, Winnie Nanyondo and Ciara Mageean moving into positions #20–23.</p><h2>Who is Sifan Hassan Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sifan Hassan</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
