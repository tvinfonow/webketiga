Who is Madison Hedgecock dating now & how much money does Madison Hedgecock have?</p><h2>Madison Hedgecock Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Madison Hedgecock</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>American Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>August 27, 1981</strong> in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, <strong>United States</strong>. Madison Smith Hedgecock, born August 27, 1981, is an American football player. He was a fullback for the National Football League (NFL), for seven seasons.&nbsp;He played college football at the University of North Carolina.&nbsp;The St. Louis Rams drafted him in the seventh round, 2005 NFL Draft.&nbsp;Hedgecock was an All-Pro selection in 2008. He won a Super Bowl ring in Super Bowl XLII with the New York Giants over the then undefeated New England Patriots.</p><p>After being drafted in round seven of the 2005 NFL Draft, Hedgecock spent the first two seasons as a professional with the St. Louis Rams.&nbsp;Hedgecock impressed the Rams coaches with his skills early on.&nbsp;Martz stated that Hedgecock is a “big hammer and a big lead blocker.”&nbsp;He fits in with what we do when it comes to running the football.&nbsp;He is very soft-spoken and a great receiver.&nbsp;These guys are very rare.” Hedgecock signed a three-year contract worth $1.1 million on July 15, 2005.&nbsp;He was praised by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for his “rapid improvement”, and he defeated Joey Goodspeed to be the Rams’ fullback.&nbsp;Goodspeed was fired after he had been in the position for two seasons.&nbsp;Mike Martz stated that the competition was a healthy one.&nbsp;Fullback is a very lost art.&nbsp;It is a very brutal position.&nbsp;It’s a brutal position.&nbsp;These two men are all about that.</p><p>During the Super Bowl media blitz Hedgecock was critical of Rams head coach Scott Linehan who was responsible for releasing him after Week one of the 2007 season. Hedgecock told a St. Louis radio station that Linehan was not well respected by many of the Rams players and was boring enough to put some players asleep. “The head coach brought in a player that he’d had in college,” Hedgecock told St. Louis radio station KSLG. Hedgecock also said about his release, “When you get fired, it’s a tough deal,” Hedgecock, the Giants’ fullback, said Wednesday after practice. “I didn’t think I did anything as a player to deserve it.” . . . “They could have at least brought in somebody that was good. He was the coach’s buddy. I don’t want to play for a buddy.”</p><p>Hedgecock was then claimed off waivers by the Giants on September 13, 2007. The Giants cut fullback Robert Douglas to make room for Hedgecock. At the time, the Giants were seeking a replacement for seven-year veteran Jim Finn, who had been placed on injured reserve with a torn labrum in his right shoulder. He signed a five-year, $5.5 million contract extension with the Giants on November 10, 2007.</p><p align=justify>As a junior, he participated in all 12 games, starting 11 at defensive end. He also made 55 tackles, 40 solo, and 15 assists. Six tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks and two fumble recovery were some of his stats.&nbsp;He played in all 12 games in his sophomore season, 2002. After being the fullback for six of the games, he moved to the defensive end for six more.&nbsp;He ran three times for 11 yards and caught two passes for 7 yard. He also made 21 total tackles (10 solo, 10 assists, 2.5 for losses)</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madison Hedgecock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hedgecock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Winston-Salem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Madison Hedgecock ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Madison Hedgecock</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Hedgecock was a student at Ledford Senior High school in Thomasville, North Carolina, and a letterman in track & field, basketball, and football.&nbsp;Hedgecock was a fullback, tight-end, and linebacker on the gridiron.&nbsp;As a senior, he rushed for 1,799 yards with 17 touchdowns and ran for 3,673 yards with 44 touchdowns during his high school career.&nbsp;He was also a three-time All-County, All-Conference selection (tightend as a sophomore and fullback respectively as a junior and senior).&nbsp;In 1998 and 1999, he was named county offensive player-of-the-year.&nbsp;Hedgecock was a Super Prep All-American, and earned honorable mention All-American status from USA Today.&nbsp;He competed in track in hurdles, relays and 200 meters. In the shot put, he was awarded All-County honors and All-Conference honors.</p><p align=justify>Hedgecock was a student at the University of North Carolina. He played on the North Carolina Tar Heels football teams from 2001 to 2004.&nbsp;He was a versatile athlete who played at fullback, running back and defensive end. He also ran for 130 yards (118 as an senior) and 2 touchdowns. In his college career, Hedgecock also recorded 83 tackles (8.5 for loss) and 1.5 sacks.&nbsp;His top running performances were a 10-carry and 69-yard victory over archrival North Carolina State, followed by a 36-yard, 10-carry performance against fourth-ranked Miami. Both of these games occurred during his senior year.&nbsp;Redshirt freshman year, he was Tar Heels’ fullback.&nbsp;After playing defense end as a sophomore and junior, he returned to fullback for his senior year in 2004.</p><p align=justify>Hedgecock was the lead blocker of Steven Jackson’s stellar 2006 season despite being slowed by injuries. He sustain a high-ankle sprain in early August 2006, and was “gimpy” for 3½ weeks of training camp. “It feels a lot better,” Hedgecock reported. “It’s loosened up some, and it’s starting to get back toward 100 percent. I was running last week, and I think that really broke up a lot of the scar tissue and got the blood flowing through it. It really helped.” Later in the season Hedgecock broke his thumb but continued to play in a Rams 30-28 loss to Seattle. He did not miss any games with that injury or another subsequent ankle sprain even though the broken thumb required in-season surgery. Through those injuries Hedgecock played well. One veteran NFC scout told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch “Steven Jackson’s one of the two, three best guys in the whole league. He’s got everything it takes . . . But when they need to put a guy in there to lead-block, Madison Hedgecock’s as good as anybody.” In addition to his lead blocking role, Hedgecock was among the Rams leaders in tackles on special teams in 2005 and 2006 and was voted the Rams Outstanding Special Teams player in 2005.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Giant teammate, All-Pro Justin Tuck told Pro Football Weekly, “Madison plays with reckless abandon, his tolerance for pain is just phenomenal”. One of the backs who rushed for 1,000 yards in 2008, Brandon Jacobs added, “He makes good blocks all the time and that’s what we need from him, to come out and do his job and he does it really well.” Jacobs added, “When he flattens a guy, that makes us jump. That gets me excited when I see something like that, when he gets going with a full head of steam and then knocking somebody out. That’s what he does, he puts people on their backs.”</p><p>After the 2008 season for the Giants, Hedgecock was voted as a First Alternate to the Pro Bowl and was a Second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He also drew praise from Hall of Fame tackle Dan Dierdorf, “Hedgecock won’t ever lead the NFL in rushing but he’ll lead block for a lot a yards and he’s a gifted receiver with soft hands who runs good routes.” Hedgeock also was named to the Sports Illustrated All-Pro team by Peter King who quipped, “Not sure, but I think he’s got an anvil in his pads.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Madison Hedgecock height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Madison <strong>weight</strong> <strong>120 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>120 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hedgecock was released following the first game of the regular season in 2007 and was replaced on the roster by Richard Owens, a fullback-tight end hybrid who had ties to Rams’ then-head coach Scott Linehan from their time together with the Minnesota Vikings, as well a brief crossover as the University of Louisville. While Hedgecock was already regarded as one of the league’s best pure blocking fullbacks., Owens never played another down in the NFL following his brief 14-game stint with St. Louis. Many saw the move as one of the most glaring examples of the ineptitude of Scott Linehan, particularly after Hedgecock signed with the Giants, played a key role in the running game during their Super Bowl winning season and signed a long-term contract extension.</p><p align=justify>He was released by the Giants on July 28, 2011 due to failing his physical. Hedgecock stated his degenerative disc disease in his back would likely end his career, “I’m old and beat up,” Hedgecock said. “If I keep playing, it’s going to get worse and worse. My hamstring (2010 injury), was because of the back being out of whack.” He also wished his replacement well, “Hopefully, they can get somebody else to do what I used to do. Maybe one of the younger guys will step up and do a good job there.”</p><h2>Who is Madison Hedgecock Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Madison Hedgecock</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
