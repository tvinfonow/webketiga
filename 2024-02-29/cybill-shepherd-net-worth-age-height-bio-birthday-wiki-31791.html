The film became a critical and box office hit, earning several Academy Awards and nominations. Shepherd was nominated for a Golden Globe. Shepherd was cast opposite Charles Grodin in The Heartbreak Kid (1972). She played Kelly, a young woman for whom Grodin’s character falls while on his honeymoon in Miami. Directed by Elaine May, it was another critical and box office hit.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Cybill Shepherd</b>'s net worth <strong>$40 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At the age of 16 she was named Miss Teenage Memphis.&nbsp;Then she was featured as the face of Glamour magazine just four years later, in the year 1970.</p><p align=justify>She was Madeleine Spencer on the series Psych from 2008 to 2013.</p><p align=justify>A series of less successful roles followed, including The Lady Vanishes, the remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1938 film of the same name. Already sitting in on an acting class taught by Stella Adler, Shepherd was offered work at a dinner theater in Norfolk, VA, and turned to friend Orson Welles for advice. He encouraged her to get experience on stage in front of an audience, anywhere but New York or Los Angeles away from the harsh big-city critics and so she moved back to her home town of Memphis to work in regional theatre.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1974, Shepherd again teamed up with Peter Bogdanovich for the title role in Daisy Miller, based on the Henry James novella. The film—a period piece set in Europe—proved to be a box office failure. That same year, she launched a singing career, releasing her debut studio album Cybill Does It…To Cole Porter for MCA Records. It was panned by Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who wrote in Christgau’s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): “Her voice is surprisingly pleasant, but you’d never know how these songs sparkle. Since Cole didn’t like to . . . do it with (or ‘to’) women very much, maybe the ‘do’ is as hostile as it sounds.”</p><p>In 1975, she made her next film, At Long Last Love, a musical which was once again directed by Bogdanovich, but like Daisy Miller, it also flopped. Shepherd returned with good reviews for her work in Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver (1976). According to Shepherd, Scorsese had requested a “Cybill Shepherd type” for the role. She portrayed an ethereal beauty with whom Robert De Niro’s character, Travis Bickle, becomes enthralled.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Cybill Shepherd height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Cybill <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to Shepherd’s autobiography, a 1970 Glamour magazine cover caught the eye of film director Peter Bogdanovich. His then-wife, Polly Platt, claimed that when she saw the cover in a check-out line in a Ralphs grocery store in southern California, she said “That’s Jacy,” referring to the role Bogdanovich was casting—and ultimately given to Shepherd—in The Last Picture Show (1971).</p><p align=justify>In 1982, Shepherd returned to New York and took to the stage soon after, when she played alongside James MacArthur in a theatre tour of Lunch Hour, by Jean Kerr. The following year, Shepherd went back to Los Angeles and soon won the role of Colleen Champion in the night-time drama, The Yellow Rose (1983), opposite Sam Elliott. Although critically acclaimed, the series lasted only one season. A year later, Shepherd was cast as Maddie Hayes on ABC’s Moonlighting (1985–1989), which became the role that defined her career. The producers knew that her role depended on having chemistry with her co-star, and she was involved in the selection of Bruce Willis. A lighthearted combination of mystery and comedy, the series won Shepherd two Golden Globe Awards.</p><h2>Who is Cybill Shepherd Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Cybill Shepherd</strong> married to <strong>Bruce Oppenheim , David M.
