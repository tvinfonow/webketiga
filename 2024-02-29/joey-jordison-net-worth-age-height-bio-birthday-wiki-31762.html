Metal drummer and songwriter who played in the band Slipknot as well as The Murderdolls.&nbsp;He also served as a producer with groups such as 3 Inches of Blood.</p><p>He was a bandmate along with&nbsp;He was bandmates with <a href=#>Corey Taylor</a> while a member of Slipknot.&nbsp;while being a part of Slipknot.</p><p>Nathan Jonas “Joey” Jordison (born April 26, 1975), is an American musician, songwriter, record producer and multi-instrumentalist, best known for his work as the former drummer and co-songwriter for the American heavy metal band Slipknot as well as guitarist in the American horror punk band Murderdolls. Jordison played in Slipknot since their formation in 1995 until his departure from the band in December 2013. He was the drummer and founder of the American heavy metal band Scar the Martyr, which formed in 2013 and disbanded in 2016. He grew up in Waukee, Iowa with his parents and two sisters, and was given his first drum kit at the age of 8. He performed with many different bands early in his career; then in the summer of 1995, he joined the group The Pale Ones, which would later change their name to Slipknot. Of Slipknot’s nine-member lineup, which lasted from 1999–2010, Joey was the third to join the band.</p><p>After leaving school, Jordison was hired by a local music store called Musicland. In March 1994, after a recommendation from his new friend, he got a job at a Sinclair garage in Urbandale. Jordison worked the night shift, which he preferred, as it left his weekends free and allowed him to spend time with his friends and listen to music while working. In early 1995, Modifidious disbanded because of a shift in interest from thrash metal to death metal in America. Following this Jordison joined a local band called The Rejects as a guitarist, with whom he only played a couple of shows. Jordison was also involved in a band with Paul Gray and vocalist Don Decker, named Anal Blast. Gray also attempted to recruit him for another band, Body Pit, but he declined the invitation to remain in The Rejects. During the forming period of Slipknot, Paul recruited Joey to join a punk band called the Have Nots in the Spring of 1996. Joey would leave the Have Nots in February 1997 to “focus on Slipknot” but instead reformed the Rejects, which would play Des Moines up until Slipknot left to record Slipknot’s self-titled album, which Paul played in after the Have Nots broke up.</p><p align=justify>Two younger siblings are Kate as well as Anne.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joey Jordison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jordison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Des Moines</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iowa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jackie Jordison, Steve Jordison</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Joey Jordison ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
