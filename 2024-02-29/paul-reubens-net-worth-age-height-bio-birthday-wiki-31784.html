A comedian most well-known for his Pee-wee Herman role in the 1985 film Peewee’s Big Adventure as well as on the television show for children called Pee-wee’s Playhouse.&nbsp;He also has appeared in movies such like Mystery Men, Matilda and Blow.</p><p>He competed alongside&nbsp;He competed with <a href=#>Gilbert Gottfried</a> for a part on Saturday Night Live.&nbsp;for an appearance on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Paul Reubens (/ˈ r uː b ən z / ; né Rubenfeld; born August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, game show host, and comedian, best known for his character Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s, and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens began appearing in a show about a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show, and ran for five sold-out months; HBO also produced a successful special about it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and, for the next decade, Reubens was completely committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. His feature film, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985), directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Its sequel, Big Top Pee-wee (1988), was less successful. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children’s program Pee-wee’s Playhouse.</p><p>In the 1970s, Reubens performed at local comedy clubs and made four guest appearances on The Gong Show as part of a boy–girl act he had developed with Charlotte McGinnis, called The Hilarious Betty and Eddie. He soon joined the Los Angeles–based improvisational comedy team The Groundlings and remained a member for six years, working with Bob McClurg, John Paragon, Susan Barnes, and Phil Hartman. Hartman and Reubens became friends, and often wrote and worked on material together. In 1980, Reubens had a small part as a waiter in The Blues Brothers.</p><p align=justify>The couple was Judy as well as Milton Rubenfeld and raised with an older brother and sister.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Reubens</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reubens</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peekskill</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Rubenfeld</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Milton Rubenfeld, Judy Rubenfeld</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Abby Rubenfeld, Luke Rubenfeld</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Reubens ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In early 2007 Nike released a collection of Nike SB sneakers called “Fallen Heroes”. The collection was loosely inspired by Milli Vanilli, MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, and Pee-wee Herman. Pee-wee’s sneakers use a gray and white color scheme with red detail, with an illustration on the insole of a man in a suit sitting alone in a theatre with his hand on his lap suggesting Reubens’ 1991 theatre arrest.</p><h2>Paul Reubens Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Reubens is one of the <strong>richest Tv Actor</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Paul Reubens</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>As a kid, he often went to Barnum & Bailey, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circuses.</p><p align=justify>He has also been an guest on shows such as TV shows like 30 Rock, Pushing Daisies and The Blacklist.</p><p align=justify>Reubens was born Paul Rubenfeld in Peekskill, New York, and grew up in Sarasota, Florida, where his parents, Judy (Rosen) and Milton Rubenfeld, owned a lamp store. His mother was a teacher. His father was an automobile salesperson who had flown for Britain’s Royal Air Force and for the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II, and later became one of the founding pilots of the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Reubens’ two younger siblings are Luke (born 1958), who is a dog trainer, and Abby (born 1953), who is an attorney and a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Reubens had not always thought of his character as one for children, but sometime during the mid-1980s, he started forming Pee-wee into the best role model he possibly could, making of his show a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity. Reubens was also careful of what should and should not be associated with Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he went to great lengths never to be photographed with a cigarette in his mouth, even refusing to endorse candy bars and other kinds of junk food, all the while trying to release his own sugar-free cereal “Ralston Purina Pee-wee Chow cereal”, a project that died after a blind test.</p><p>When Pee-wee’s fame started growing, Reubens started to move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public appearance and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to “get the public to think that that was a real person”. Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline’s in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Reubens height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Paul <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The character of “Pee-wee Herman” originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens came up with the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé’s Tintin and Collodi’s Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for “Pee-wee” but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee’s voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking that would become Pee-wee’s. Pee-wee’s name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The first small gray suit Pee-wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens, while “someone” handed him the “little kid bow tie” before a show.</p><p align=justify>With the help of other Groundlings like John Paragon, Phil Hartman and Lynne Marie Stewart, Pee-wee acquired a small group of followers and Reubens took his show to The Roxy Theatre where “The Pee-wee Herman Show” ran for five sellout months, doing midnight shows for adults and weekly matinees for children, moving into the mainstream when HBO aired The Pee-wee Herman Show in 1981 as part of their series On Location. Reubens also appeared as Pee-wee in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong’s Next Movie. Although it was Reubens in the role of Pee-Wee, the end credits of the movie billed him as Hamburger Dude. Reubens’ act had mainly positive reactions and quickly acquired a group of fans, despite being described as “bizarre”, and Reubens being described as “the weirdest comedian around”. Pee-wee was both “corny” and “hip”, “retrograde” and “avant-garde”.</p><h2>Who is Paul Reubens Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Reubens</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

(In 1991, while presenting at the Emmy Awards, Gottfried ironically got in trouble for joking about Reubens’ indecent exposure arrest.)

Paul Reubens celebrates birthday on August 27 of every year.</p><p align=justify>The success of The Pee-wee Herman Show prompted Warner Bros. to hire Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens’ original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna, which Reubens claims is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure saw Tim Burton’s work on Vincent and Frankenweenie, they chose Burton to be the film’s director. The film tells the story of Pee-wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle. The movie went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically, recouping almost six times its $7&nbsp;million budget. At the time of release in 1985, the film received mixed reviews, but Pee-wee’s Big Adventure developed into a cult film.</p><h3>Why did Pee-wee Playhouse get Cancelled?</h3><p>The show — canceled in April because of <b>poor ratings</b> — had been in reruns at 11:30 a.m. every Saturday.
