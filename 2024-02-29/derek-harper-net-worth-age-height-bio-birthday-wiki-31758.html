A 17-year old NBA point guard who is known for his tenacity and defensive skills.</p><p>He was a regular in The Dallas Mavericks alongside forward&nbsp;He played for several seasons with the Dallas Mavericks alongside forward <a href=#>Sam Perkins</a>..</p><p>After graduating from Roosevelt Junior High School and then North Shore High School in West Palm Beach, Harper played three seasons for the Fighting Illini and coach Lou Henson having his best season in 1982–1983, when he led the Fighting Illini in scoring with 15.4 points per game. Harper was named First-Team All-Big Ten and Second-Team All-American in 1983, and was Honorable Mention All-Big Ten in both 1981 and 1982. Harper averaged 4.7 assists per game for his collegiate career, and led the Big Ten in assists in the 1981–1982 season. Harper was elected to the “Illini Men’s Basketball All-Century Team” in 2004.</p><p>At 6&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in, Harper was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks with the 11th overall pick of the 1983 NBA draft. He spent his first ten seasons with them, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. For almost the entire time in his first stint with the team, he was part of the starting backcourt tandem with All-Star shooting guard Rolando Blackman. The Mavericks made the playoffs 6 out of the 10 years of Harper’s tenure with the team, and they made it to the Western Conference Finals in the 1987-1988 season, but they were never able to replicate that success for any other season of Harper’s time in Dallas. He had multiple seasons of averaging well over 10 PPG easily, he became well known for being a great scorer and defender. His best season came in 1990-1991 where he averaged 19.7 PPG. But he still wasn’t selected to be an all star and the Mavericks finished that year with an unpleasant 28-54 record. Harper still played well for the rest of his time in Dallas, but the team was atrocious. In the 1992-1993 season especially, the Mavericks finished 11-71 which is one of the worst records of all time. Harper spent 2 more seasons with the Mavericks before leaving the team during the 1993-1994 season.</p><p align=justify>He was married to his partner Sheila and together they had three daughters.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Derek Harper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Derek</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elberton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sheila Harper</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Darius Harper, Dana Harper</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Derek Harper ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The Knicks were looking for a defensive point guard to replace the injured Doc Rivers, who was sidelined for the rest of the season. The shift sent him from a team that finished 13–69 to being an integral part of one that came within one game of winning the 1994 NBA Championship. His stats declined as he had to adjust to having less of an individual role, but his best season with the Knicks came in his last year with the team where he averaged 14.0 PPG. On July 14, 1996 he was released by the Knicks and became a free agent.</p><h2>Derek Harper Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Derek Harper is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.
