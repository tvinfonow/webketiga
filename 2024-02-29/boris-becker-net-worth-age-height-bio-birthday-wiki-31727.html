As a German teenager, Becker won the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before taking his first top-level singles title in June that year at Queen’s Club. Two weeks later, on 7 July, he became the first unseeded player and the first German to win the Wimbledon singles title, defeating Kevin Curren in four sets. Becker was at that time ranked 20th in ATP ranking, and was unseeded, as at that time Wimbledon did not seed players beyond the top 16. He was the youngest ever male Grand Slam singles champion at 17&nbsp;years, 227&nbsp;days (a record later broken by Michael Chang in 1989, who won the French Open when he was 17&nbsp;years, 110&nbsp;days). Two months after his triumph, Becker became the youngest winner of the Cincinnati Open. Becker has since said that “the plan from my parents for me was to finish school, go to university, get a proper degree and learn something respectful. The last thing on everyone’s mind was me becoming a tennis professional.”</p><h2>Boris Becker Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Boris Becker is one of the <strong>richest Tennis Player</strong> from Netherlands.

In 1981, he was included in the Federation’s first men’s team. In 1982, he won the doubles at the Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships.</p><p align=justify>Becker was most comfortable playing on fast-playing surfaces, particularly grass courts and indoor carpet (on which he won 26 titles). He reached a few finals playing on clay courts, but never won a clay-court tournament in his professional career. His best performances at the French Open were when he reached the semifinals in 1987, 1989, and 1991. Becker was close to winning a clay court tournament in his last final on the surface, when he led Thomas Muster by two sets to love in the 1995 Monte Carlo Open final, and double-faulted on match point in the fourth-set tiebreaker.</p><h2>Who is Boris Becker Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Boris Becker</strong> married to <strong>Lilly Becker , Barbara Becker </strong>.
