Who is Tom Conte dating now & how much money does Tom Conte have?</p><h2>Tom Conte Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tom Conte</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Engineer</strong> who was born on <strong>July 29, 1964</strong> in Wilmington, Delaware, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Conte received his Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree in 1986 from the University of Delaware, his Master of Science in electrical engineering in 1988 from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and his Doctor of Philosophy in electrical engineering in 1992 from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He started his career as an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina. In 1995, Conte moved to North Carolina State University (in Raleigh, North Carolina), where he was an assistant professor (1995–1998), then an associate professor (1998–2002), and finally a full professor of electrical and computer engineering (2003–2008). During the summer of 2008 Conte moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and took his current position as a joint full professor of computer science in the College of Computing and Electrical & Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. Somewhere in there (2000–2001) he took a short detour to DSP startup BOPS, inc. to serve as a manager of their back and compiler group and “chief microarchitect” (because they already had a “chief architect”).</p><p>Conte realized in the early 1990s that Flynn’s prediction of the fetch bandwidth being the limit to increasing instruction-level parallelism was coming true. His oft-cited International Symposium on Computer Architecture paper and subsequent work on instruction fetch mechanisms have influenced industry and spawned much follow-on research. More recently, Conte and his Ph.D. students invented a technique to predict data values with very high (~90%) accuracy and showed how predicting data values can be used to scale the memory wall by enabling aggressive prefetching. The work is of great interest to industry design teams who are struggling with performance limitations imposed by the speed gap between microprocessors and memory systems. Conte and his students have also developed a very small yet highly effective prefetcher termed the Spectral Prefetcher. This was published in the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom Conte</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tommy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Engineer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wilmington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Delaware</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tom Conte ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

One well-known example is that his technique for the then-pressing problem (ca. early ‘90s) of VLIW cross-generation code compatibility. In a technique he and his students termed “dynamic rescheduling,” Conte brought to bear on the problem collaboration between the ISA, the hardware and the compiler to reschedule code with minimal performance loss at first-time page misses to the code. This work has major implications on the long-term viability of the EPIC architecture proposed in Intel Itanium processor family. The research also helped make code optimization during runtime a practical approach. In this way, his research is now also considered one of the pioneering works on dynamic code optimization. One of his Ph.D. students went on to build tools such as the HP Dynamo dynamic optimizer and another Ph.D. student went on to build the IBM DAISY dynamic optimizer.</p><h2>Who is Tom Conte Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tom Conte</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
