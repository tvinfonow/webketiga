The district had been significantly altered in redistricting. New lines were drawn straight through the middle of Warren Wilson College. Notably, it lost most of Asheville to the 10th district, while picking up some heavily Republican territory in the foothills. The old 11th had a slight Republican lean, but the new 11th was on paper the most Republican district in the state. In 2011 the North Carolina state legislature redrew the congressional districts based on updated population information from the 2010 census. As a result the district is now 91.2% White, 3.0% Black, 1.4% Native American and 1.0% Asian. District 11 now includes Buncombe (Asheville), Clay, Cherokee, Graham, Haywood (Waynesville), Henderson (Hendersonville), Jackson (Sylva), Macon (Franklin), McDowell (Marion), Madison, Polk, Swain, Transylvania (Brevard) and Yancey (Burnsville) counties.</p><p align=justify>Less than a year after taking office, Meadows wrote the letter that initially urged House Speaker John Boehner to shut down the government unless the ACA was defunded. Some constituents have criticized him as responsible for the 2013 government shutdown; The Washington Post called him its “chief architect”. His district lost up to $1 million per day during the shutdown because the national parks were closed.</p><h2>Who is Mark Meadows Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mark Meadows</strong> married to <strong>Debbie Meadows</strong>.

He was one of several Republicans who claimed the funding bill contained pork-barrel spending that had nothing to do with hurricane relief, a claim the bill’s supporters denied. Meadows’s opposition to Sandy relief was recalled in 2017 news accounts after he and many Republicans who had opposed it voted in favor of disaster aid following Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive damage in Louisiana and Texas that August. Critics alleged that Republicans were hypocritically opposing spending in states with Democratic majorities while supporting it in Republican states. Republicans, including Meadows, claimed the situations were different because the Harvey spending bill contained no “pork”. A Congressional Research Service review determined that the Sandy spending bill’s funds were almost all devoted to recovery from Sandy.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Marshall Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Former White House Chief Of Staff</strong>.
