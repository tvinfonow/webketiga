Kathryn Dawn Lang OC AOE (born November 2, 1961), known by her stylized stage name k.d. lang, is a Canadian pop and country singer-songwriter and occasional actress.</p><p>Singing at country and western venues in Canada, Lang began to establish an appearance and style referred to as “cowboy punk”. She was called a “Canadian Cowpunk” in the June 20, 1985 issue of Rolling Stone.She would later recall the inspiration for her defining look in an interview with The Canadian Press: “I used to sew plastic cowboys and Indians on my clothes – just having fun with it on a budget. I was broke at the time, so I’d find things at Value Village or get my mom to make me a skirt from the curtains she was about to throw out. I loved playing with the clothes as much as the music.”</p><p>Lang performed several times on The Super Dave Osborne Show starting in 1987. In 1988 k.d. lang and The Reclines appeared on Austin City Limits. Lang played the lead in the 1991 drama film Salmonberries, and also co-starred with Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd in Eye of the Beholder (1999).
