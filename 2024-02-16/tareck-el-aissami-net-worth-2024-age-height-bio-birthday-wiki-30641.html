He previously was Minister of the Interior and Justice from 2008 to 2012, Governor of Aragua from 2012 to 2017 and Vice President of Venezuela from 2017 to 2018. While holding that office, El Aissami faced allegations of participating in corruption, money laundering and drug trafficking. In 2019, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) added El Aissami to the ICE Most Wanted List, listed by the Homeland Security Investigations unit.</p><p>El Aissami’s father supported Hugo Chávez during the February 1992 Venezuelan coup d’état attempt and was arrested. Following the news of his father’s arrest and the raiding of his childhood home, seventeen-year-old El Aissami became disillusioned with the state of Venezuela. A quote from his father stuck with El Aissami for life, “No matter what happens, remember the capable men are the ones who write history, the incapable criticize it”, with his father referring to Chávez as being able to rewrite history. Following the arrest of El Aissami’s father in 1992, his great-uncle Shibli El Aissami retired from politics in Iraq, remaining in the country until the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tareck El Aissami</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Seina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nakajima</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alberto Adriani Municipality</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mérida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Venezuela</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>May Maddah de El Aissami, Zaidan El Amin El Aissami</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Firaz Al-Aissami, Amin Obayda El Aissami, Haifa Al-Aissami</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rudy Amer de El Aissami</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tareck El Aissami ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Unnamed opponents claimed that during student elections El Aissami threatened other candidates with armed gangs, while former governor Florencio Porras (PSUV) accused him of attempting to rig student elections.
