American television producer and writer for the long-running Simpsons animated franchise.</p><p>He worked as a writer for The Tonight Show Starring <a href=#>Johnny Carson</a> with fellow Harvard alum Mike Reiss.</p><p>Alfred Ernest Jean III (born January 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter and producer. Jean is well known for his work on The Simpsons. He was born and raised near Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Harvard University in 1981. Jean began his writing career in the 1980s with fellow Harvard alum Mike Reiss. Together, they worked as writers and producers on television shows such as The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF and It’s Garry Shandling’s Show.</p><p>The humor magazine National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss after they graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period, they worked as writers and producers on television shows such as The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It’s Garry Shandling’s Show. In 1989, Jean was offered a job as a writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean’s friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.</p><p align=justify>He married fellow television writer Stephanie Gillis in 2009.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al Jean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Producer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Detroit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stephanie Gillis (m. 2002)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Al Jean ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Jean was offered a job as a writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons in 1989, alongside Reiss, and together they became the first members of the original writing staff of the show. They served as showrunners during the show’s third (1991) and fourth (1992) seasons, though they left The Simpsons after season four to create The Critic, an animated show about film critic Jay Sherman. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 (then aired its second season on Fox in March 1995) and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and only lasted for two seasons.</p><h2>Al Jean Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Al Jean is one of the <strong>richest TV Producer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Al Jean</b>'s net worth <strong>$200 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He developed his comedic skill writing for the Harvard Lampoon publication.</p><p align=justify>He helped produce 250 episodes of The Simpsons, as well as The Simpsons Movie from 2007.</p><p align=justify>Al Jean was born Alfred Ernest Jean III on January 9, 1961. He was born and raised in Farmington Hills, Michigan, graduated from Farmington Hills Harrison High School, and is of Irish ancestry. After working at his father’s hardware store, Jean arrived at Harvard University when he was sixteen years old and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. Daryl Libow, one of Jean’s freshman roommates, said he was a “math whiz” when he arrived at Harvard but “soon blossomed and found his comedic feet.” In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Jean met fellow freshman Mike Reiss; they befriended one another and collaborated their writing efforts for the humor publication Harvard Lampoon. Jeff Martin, another writer for the Lampoon, said “they definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success.” Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the Lampoon, adding that “it was practically my second dorm room.” He eventually became vice-president of the publication.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$200 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Producer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jean became showrunner of The Simpsons at the start of the third season (1991) together with Reiss. A showrunner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting and the music. When Jean began his tenure as showrunner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was “Don’t blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves.” The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was “Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington” (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt pressured to make it good, so much so that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he “kept thinking ‘It’s not good enough. It’s not good enough.'” Reiss added that “we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.”</p><p>Jean and Reiss served as showrunners until the end of the fourth season in 1993. Since the show had already established itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of The Simpsons. Bill Oakley, another Simpsons writer, has commented that “Mike and Al are responsible for the best thing that ever appeared on television, which was the third season of The Simpsons.” Comedy writer Jay Kogen has said that “those years with Al Jean and Mike Reiss running it were pretty darn good. And then the ones after that maybe not so much. Some people ran it better than others.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Al Jean height</b> Not available right now.

While watching the first episode of the show, “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire”, premiering on television in December 1989, Jean opined to himself that the series was the greatest project he had been involved with and desired to continue working on it for the rest of his professional career. What he enjoyed most about The Simpsons at the time was something he recognized from Brooks’ previous work: although the show was largely based on humor, it had depth and warmth.</p><p align=justify>Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons after its fourth season in order to create The Critic, an animated show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and The Critic.</p><h2>Who is Al Jean Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Al Jean</strong> married to <strong>Stephanie Gillis (m. 2002)</strong>.

I had 11 executives full-time telling me how to do my job.” The pair periodically returned to work on The Simpsons— for example, while under contract at Disney they were allowed to write and produce four episodes of the show, including season eight’s “Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious” (1997).</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Al Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Producer</strong>.
