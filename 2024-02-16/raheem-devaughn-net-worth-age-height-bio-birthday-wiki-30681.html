DeVaughn has described himself as a “R&B hippie neo-soul rock star,” a take on the difficulty media types have classifying him. Although Jive has been thrown considerable weight behind his recent album, DeVaughn doesn’t leave promotion duties entirely to his label: “I’m my best marketing tool. I’m building the brand Raheem DeVaughn. I have to do it.” He worked on the street to spread the word around, sold mixtapes of unreleased material to build hype, and provided impromptu shows at local venues. In another act of self-promotion, DeVaughn made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in late January, wearing a shirt that read “Grammy Nominated on the front” and “Love Behind the Melody– In Stores Now” on the back. He also appeared on the late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, performing “Woman” on January 18, 2008.</p><h2>Raheem Devaughn Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Raheem Devaughn is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from United States.

He was raised in Maryland (Montgomery and Prince George’s counties) by his mother, Imani Smith, a now retired federal worker. He is a cousin of singer Chrisette Michele. His mother states that her son first expressed an affinity towards music in preschool, recalling how whenever the class had musical events, he would conduct them. DeVaughn’s love for music solidified during his early teens, when he began to envision his career path. One of his favorite artists was Babyface, and Smith recalls that her son once begged her to visit the Waxie Maxie’s record store in the District to buy a promotional picture of the singer. DeVaughn visited his father during the summer, mainly in New Jersey. With his father, DeVaughn attended gigs and experienced his first taste of the life of a working musician.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>DeVaughn was nominated for “Best R&B Album” in the 2011 Grammy Awards.</p><p>In September 2013, DeVaughn released his fourth studio album A Place Called Love Land on new label Mass Appeal Entertainment.
