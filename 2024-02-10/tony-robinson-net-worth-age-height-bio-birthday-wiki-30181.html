Who is Tony Robinson dating now & how much money does Tony Robinson have?</p><h2>Tony Robinson Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tony Robinson</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>American Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>January 22, 1964</strong> in Monticello, Monticello, <strong>United States</strong>. Kevin Altona “Tony” Robinson (born January 22, 1964) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League for the Super Bowl-winning Washington Redskins as a replacement member of their team during the 1987 players’ strike. Along with other Redskins replacement players from that year, he was eventually awarded a Super Bowl ring.</p><p>Robinson played college football at the University of Tennessee from 1982 to 1985. After spending his first two seasons as a backup, he guided the 1984 squad to a 7–4–1 record and an appearance in the Sun Bowl. He led the 1985 “Sugar Vols” squad through a difficult first half of the season, and was a Heisman Trophy candidate until blowing out his right knee during a close game against Alabama. A few weeks after the season, he was arrested in Knoxville on charges of distributing cocaine, critically damaging his prospects in the NFL. He went undrafted in the 1986 NFL Draft.</p><p>Robinson finished the 1984 season with 153 completions on 256 passes for 1,963 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions, falling just short of Alan Cockrell’s school single-season record of 2,021 passing yards. He also rushed for 126 yards and 3 touchdowns, giving him a school-record 2,089 yards of total offense. His 61.7% completion rate also set a record, surpassing Johnny Majors’ 1956 mark of 61.3%.</p><p>Robinson delivered another strong performance in Tennessee’s game against rival Alabama on October 20, 1984. With Alabama leading 27–13 midway through the fourth quarter, Robinson engineered a scoring drive which culminated with a 17-yard touchdown pass to McGee. Teammate Andre Creamer then returned a punt to the Alabama 11-yard line, and Jones scored from a yard out a few plays later to cut the lead to 27–26 with just over two minutes remaining. Majors opted to go for the two-point conversion, which Robinson scored by faking a pitch to Jones and diving over the goal line, giving Tennessee a 28–27 victory, and setting off a wild celebration at Neyland Stadium. Robinson was named “Southeast Back of the Week” by the Associated Press for his performance.</p><p align=justify>Robinson eventually signed with Tennessee. Volunteers head coach Johnny Majors had also waffled on Robinson’s recruitment, expressing concern over a roster already packed with quarterbacks, but made up his mind at the last minute and offered Robinson a scholarship. Robinson joined Tennessee’s stellar 1982 recruiting class, which included future NFL players Tim McGee, Joey Clinkscales, Charles Davis, Bruce Wilkerson, and Daryle Smith.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Monticello</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Monticello</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Louise Hobbs (m. 2011), Mary Shepherd (m. 1972–1992)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tony Robinson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Many of his acquaintances recalled that he became more withdrawn. In a later interview, Robinson admitted he had started using cocaine in 1985. In January 1986, a few days after Tennessee’s victory in the 1986 Sugar Bowl (which Robinson watched from the sidelines), he and his roommate, former Vol fullback Kenneth B.B. Cooper, were arrested by Knoxville police in a sting operation. Robinson was subsequently charged with taking part in the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. He eventually pleaded no contest to lesser charges, and was sentenced to nine months in prison.</p><h2>Tony Robinson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tony Robinson is one of the <strong>richest American Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tony Robinson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Robinson was born in Monticello, Florida, the son of Johnnie Robinson, a truck driver, and his wife, Jean. He grew up in Tallahassee, where he played football with neighborhood kids from a very young age. He played high school football at Tallahassee’s Leon High School under heralded coach Gene Cox. He joined Leon’s junior varsity squad as a freshman in 1978, initially playing at wide receiver, but switching to quarterback when Cox noticed how easily he could throw the ball long distances.</p><p align=justify>Tennessee had signed multiple quarterbacks in 1982. After a few practices, however, most realized they would not win the starting job over Robinson. Several, including Clinkscales and Davis, found new positions, while others left the team. During his freshman year, Robinson was a backup to star quarterback Alan Cockrell, and played very little. He led Tennessee’s junior varsity team to a 3–1 record, however, completing 15 of 29 passes for 412 yards and seven touchdowns, and rushing for 109 yards. Robinson remained a backup to Cockrell during the 1983 season. He received his only significant playing time in Tennessee’s 37–3 win over Georgia Tech, completing 6 of 12 passes for 123 yards and a 35-yard touchdown.</p><p align=justify>After a hard-fought victory over Wake Forest, Tennessee traveled to Gainesville to face the #7 Florida Gators, who had not lost since the first week of the 1984 season. Robinson completed 26 of 36 passes for 300 yards, but managed just one touchdown pass—a 20-yarder to McGee in the fourth quarter—as the Florida defense successfully executed a “bend-but-don’t-break” strategy. Late in the fourth quarter, with Tennessee trailing 17–10, Robinson led the Vols to midfield, but the drive ended when his pass was tipped by Florida defensive tackle Rhondy Weston and intercepted by linebacker Alonzo Johnson to seal the victory for the Gators.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Robinson’s single-game record of 417 yards of total offense against UCLA in 1985 was broken by Peyton Manning, who accumulated 475 yards against Florida in 1996. Robinson’s tally is now the school’s fourth-highest single-game total. His 389 yards of total offense against Florida in 1984 remains the school’s eighth-highest single-game total. His single-season record of 2,089 total yards was broken by Jeff Francis in 1988, and has since been surpassed several times.</p><p>On October 19, 1985, Tennessee traveled to Birmingham to play Alabama, who were ranked #15 and entered the game with a 4–1 record following a 19–17 loss to Penn State. Both offenses struggled to move the ball for most of the game, though Robinson and freshman running back Keith Davis had garnered enough offensive production to give Tennessee a 13-7 lead after three quarters. Following an Alabama turnover, Tennessee had driven inside the Alabama 10-yard line early in the fourth quarter. On a 2nd-and-1 scramble, Robinson was sandwiched between linebacker Cornelius Bennett and defensive lineman Curt Jarvis, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. He recalled Bennett saying, “T-man, stay down, you’re hurt. I can feel it.” Though stunned with Robinson out of the game, Tennessee regrouped and held on for a 16–14 victory.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tony Robinson height</b> <strong>5′ 4″</strong> Tony <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5′ 4″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Robinson’s breakout performance came in Tennessee’s shootout against rival Florida on October 13, 1984. He completed a school-record 29 passes for 371 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown pass to Tim McGee in the first quarter, and a 48-yard touchdown pass to Joey Clinkscales that pulled the Vols to within a score in the fourth quarter. He also had 18 yards rushing, giving him 389 yards of total offense, which was also a school record. Tennessee’s defense was unable to stop Florida’s running back tandem of Neal Anderson and John L. Williams, however, and the Gators prevailed 43-30.</p><p align=justify>Robinson was named Preseason All-SEC prior to the 1985 season. He was also considered a contender for the Heisman Trophy. In Tennessee’s season opener against 10th-ranked UCLA, he threw for a school record 387 yards and two touchdowns, including a 68-yard bomb to Clinkscales, and rushed for 30 yards, giving him 417 total yards to break his own school record for total offense. The Bruins rallied to score 16 points late in the fourth quarter, however, to escape with a 26-26 tie.</p><h2>Who is Tony Robinson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tony Robinson</strong> married to <strong>Louise Hobbs (m. 2011), Mary Shepherd (m. 1972–1992)</strong>.
