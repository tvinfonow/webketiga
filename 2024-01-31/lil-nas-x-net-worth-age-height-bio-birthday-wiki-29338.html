His parents divorced when he was six, and he settled in the Bankhead Courts housing project with his mother and grandmother. Three years later, he moved in with his father, a gospel singer, north of the city in Austell, Georgia. Although initially reluctant to leave, he later regarded it as an important decision: “There’s so much shit going on in Atlanta—if I would have stayed there, I would have fallen in with the wrong crowd.” He started “using the Internet heavily right around the time when memes started to become their own form of entertainment”; about when he was thirteen.</p><p>Montero Lamar Hill (born April 9, 1999), known as Lil Nas X (/n ɑː z / NAHZ ), is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He came to international attention for his country rap single “Old Town Road”, which first achieved viral popularity on the micro-platform video sharing app TikTok in early 2019, and was Diamond certified by November the same year. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and remained there for nineteen weeks, the longest for any song since the chart debuted in 1958. In June 2019, Nas X came out as gay, the only artist ever to have done so while having a number-one record. “Old Town Road” earned him two MTV Video Music Awards including Song of the Year; the American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip Hop Song; and Nas X is the only openly LGBTQ artist to win a Country Music Association award. He won two Grammy Awards, for Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance along with being nominated for a total of six, the most for any male in 2019. TIME placed him on their inaugural TIME 100 Next list. Nas X was also named by Forbes on their 2020 30 under 30 list.</p><p align=justify>He hails from Atlanta, Georgia.&nbsp;Montero Lamar Hills is his real name.&nbsp;In 2019, he came out as gay.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lil Nas X</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>X</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1999</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lithia Springs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lil Nas X ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Lil Nas X</b>'s net worth <strong>$4 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>In 2018, he released his first project, Naserati.</p><p align=justify>His country-trap hit “Old Town Road”, which is his country-trap single, interpolates Nine Inch Nails’ 2008 song “34 Ghosts IV.”&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption video game footage is used in the music video.</p><p align=justify>For the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards Nas X wore several outfits including a head-to-toe couture fuschia Versace suit with a pink harness which took 700 hours to construct.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On December 3, 2018, Nas X released the country rap song “Old Town Road”. He bought the beat for the song anonymously on an online store from Dutch producer YoungKio for $30; it samples Nine Inch Nails’ track “34 Ghosts IV” from their sixth studio album Ghosts I–IV (2008). He recorded at a “humble” Atlanta studio, CinCoYo, on their “$20 Tuesdays” taking less than an hour. Nas X began creating memes to promote “Old Town Road” before it was picked up by short-form video social media TikTok users. TikTok encourages its 500 million global users to “endless imitation,” with videos generating copies usually using the same music; the “app’s frantic churn of content …acts as a potent incubator for viral music hits.” Nas X estimated he made about a hundred memes to promote it; the song went viral in early 2019 due to the #Yeehaw Challenge meme on TikTok. Millions of users posted videos of themselves dressed as a wrangler or cowgirl, with most #yeehaw videos using the song for their soundtrack; as of July 2019, they have been seen more than 67 million times. Another core audience tied to social media is children who are hidden in the statistics of adult listeners. Quartz.com says the song certainly owes part of its success to the demographic, and notes they are attracted to the song being repetitive, easy to sing along to, and using lyrics about riding horses and tractors, which kids can relate to. It debuted at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, later climbing to number one. The track also debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart at number 19 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 36. After an “intense bidding war”, Nas X signed with Columbia Records in March 2019. Billboard controversially removed the song from the Hot Country songs chart in March 2019 telling Rolling Stone:</p><p>He then landed on music as a path to success, and started writing and recording songs in his closet. He adopted the name Lil Nas X, which is a tribute to the rapper Nas. In late October 2018, he ran across the music that would be “Old Town Road”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lil Nas X height</b> Not available right now.

In 2017, this account gained attention for its flash fiction-style interactive “scenario threads” popularized on Twitter using dashboard app TweetDeck. The investigation linked @NasMaraj to the practice of “Tweetdecking”, or using multiple accounts in collaboration to artificially make certain tweets go viral. The @NasMaraj account was suspended by Twitter due to “violating spam policies”. After the suspension of @NasMaraj, New York Magazine’s investigation concluded that he subsequently opened a new account with handle “@NasMarai”, and that his current Twitter account at the time was a repurposed version of that “@NasMarai” account with a changed handle. After media reports linked Nas X to the Minaj fan accounts, he called the reports a “misunderstanding”, effectively denying having run the accounts.</p><p align=justify>Nas X has been noted for his public fashions; in July 2019, Vogue noted Nas X as a “master” at giving the cowboy aesthetic a glam look in his appearances and on Instagram. His stylist, Hodo Musa, says he aims for items that are “electric, playful, colorful, and futuristic.” For his on-stage look at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards he wore a cowboy motif cherry-red Nudie suit. Wrangler, which is mentioned in the “Old Town Road” lyrics, has consistently sold out of Nas X co-branded fashions.</p><h2>Who is Lil Nas X Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lil Nas X</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

On June 30, 2019, the last day of Pride Month, Nas X came out publicly as gay, tweeting: “some of y’all already know, some of y’all don’t care, some of y’all not gone fwm no more. but before this month ends i want y’all to listen closely to c7osure. ✨” The tweet confirmed earlier suspicions when he first indicated this in his track “c7osure”. Rolling Stone noted the song “touches on themes such as coming clean, growing up and embracing one’s self”. The next day he tweeted again, this time highlighting the rainbow-colored building on the cover art of his EP 7, with the caption reading “deadass thought i made it obvious”. He was unambiguous in an interview several days later on BBC Breakfast, where he stated that he was gay and understands that his sexuality is not readily accepted in the country or rap music communities. The response to the news was mostly positive, but also garnered a large amount of homophobic backlash on social media, to which Nas X also reacted. The backlash also came from the hip hop community, drawing attention to homophobia in hip hop culture. In January 2020, rapper Pastor Troy made some homophobic comments on the outfit Nas X wore during the Grammy Awards, to which Nas X nonchalantly responded: “Damn I look good in that pic on god.”.</p><h2>Top Facts about Lil Nas X</h2><li>Lil Nas X was born in 1999 in Atlanta, Georgia.</li><li>His real name is Montero Lamar Hill.</li><li>He gained fame with his hit single “Old Town Road”.</li><li>“Old Town Road” spent a record-breaking 19 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</li><li>Lil Nas X came out as gay in June 2019.</li><li>He won two Grammy Awards in 2020 for “Old Town Road”.</li><li>Lil Nas X has over 18 million monthly listeners on Spotify.</li><li>His debut EP, “7”, was released in June 2019.</li><li>In March 2021, he released his controversial music video for “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)”.</li><li>Lil Nas X has collaborated with artists such as Billy Ray Cyrus and Cardi B.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Lil Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rapper</strong>.
