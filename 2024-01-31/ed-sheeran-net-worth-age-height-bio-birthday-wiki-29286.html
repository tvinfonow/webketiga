I did something for his record, and I was credited as ‘Angelo Mysterioso,’ [appearing as a guest on Clapton’s “I Will Be There”, in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage], and he did something for my record [performing a guitar solo on “Dive” on Sheeran’s album ÷] and was credited as ‘Angelo Mysterioso.'” Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.</p><p align=justify>His brother <a href=#>Matthew</a> is also a singer.
