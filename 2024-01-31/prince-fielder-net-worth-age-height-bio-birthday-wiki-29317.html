While playing the San Francisco Giants on September 6, Fielder hit his third career walk-off home run in the 12th inning. The Brewers’ subsequent home plate celebration sparked a minor controversy due to its unusual style. Then, on September 19, Fielder set the Brewers’ single-season record for RBIs at 127, beating Cecil Cooper’s 1983 record of 126. He set this record during a game against the Houston Astros — the team Cooper was managing at the time. The record-breaking RBI was a sacrifice fly, scoring Mike Cameron.

Fielder stated that he hoped to surpass his father’s total of 51 home runs in a season (1990) as a way of exorcising the demons that came with being the son of a prominent major leaguer. “A lot of people said that’s the only reason I got drafted… I don’t mind people comparing me to him but I’m a completely different player. One day I want people to mention my name and not have to mention his,” Fielder said. Earlier in the season, Cecil Fielder had told a magazine that it was his famous name that led to his son being such a highly touted prospect. The younger Fielder also saw his contention in the 2007 NL MVP race as a way of proving his father wrong, but got little else from the rift but motivation saying, “You’ve got to look at who’s saying it. Let’s be honest. He’s not really the brightest guy.”</p><h2>Prince Fielder Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Prince Fielder is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from United States.
