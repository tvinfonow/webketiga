Celek followed it up with 3 catches for 44 yards and another touchdown against the Saints. Celek only caught 2 passes for 11 yards in a game against the Panthers, and against the Cowboys he caught no passes.

Mark Sanchez started 2 of these games, and played in all 3, although Bradford threw 3 of Celek’s 4 catches against Miami.
