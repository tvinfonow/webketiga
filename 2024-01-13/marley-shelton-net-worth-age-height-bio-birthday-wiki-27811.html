Both films rated poorly with reviewers and failed to attract the audiences, but James Berardinelli singled out Shelton for her performance in Warrior of Vitue, writing that her character is “the only one in the film that we develop any real interest in, and the script, apparently unable to deal with a personality having the potential to display more than one dimension, discards her perfunctorily and inelegantly”.</p><h2>Marley Shelton Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Marley Shelton is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actress</strong> from United States.

She played Diane Weston, the head of a group of high school cheerleaders who conspire and commit armed robbery. The film garnered negative reviews and bombed commercially in theaters, but became somewhat of a cult favorite afterwards. Despite critical reviews, Variety magazine found Shelton to be “good” as “the ridiculously peppy but still smart Diane”, and Brian Orndorf wrote for Film Fodder: “The star who emerges from Spice unscathed is Marley Shelton. She achieves the unthinkable with this script by managing to create somewhat of a character for herself. A clear-eyed beauty, Shelton steals the film away from the sizable cast. She emerges as the only thing to recommend in the muddled and compromised Sugar & Spice.”</p><h2>Who is Marley Shelton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Marley Shelton</strong> married to <strong>Beau Flynn </strong>.
