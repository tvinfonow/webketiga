Who is Barry Minkow dating now & how much money does Barry Minkow have?</p><h2>Barry Minkow Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Barry Minkow</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pastor</strong> who was born on <strong>March 22, 1966</strong> in Inglewood, California, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Just as the merger was about to close, Minkow was exposed by the discovery of the credit card fraud that helped keep his company alive in the early years. Minkow had blamed the fraudulent charges on unscrupulous contractors and another employee, and paid back most of the victims. However, he had not paid back a homemaker who had been overcharged a few hundred dollars. When Minkow ignored her requests to pay her pack, she tracked down several other people who had been defrauded by Minkow and gave a diary of her findings to the Los Angeles Times. The Times then wrote a story revealing that Minkow had run up $72,000 in fraudulent credit card charges in 1984 and 1985. The story, which ran just days before the KeyServ merger was to close, sent ZZZZ Best stock plunging 28 percent.</p><p>After graduating from high school in 1985, Minkow devoted all of his time to ZZZZ Best. Short of cash despite the recent expansion, he got a loan from Jack Catain, a Los Angeles businessman who had ties to organized crime. Catain later sued Minkow for not paying him his share of the company’s profits, but Minkow claimed Catain was a usurer. The suit was still working its way through the courts at the time of Catain’s death in 1987. Other organized crime figures turned up as Minkow’s advisers, which unnerved his employees. For instance, a major shareholder, Maurice Rind, had been convicted of securities fraud in 1976. Minkow was also a business partner with Robert Viggiano, a convicted jewel thief and reputed loanshark.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry Minkow</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Veneman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Inglewood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert Minkow, Carole Minkow</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dylan Gene Minkow, Robert Irwin Minkow</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Barry Minkow ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The company now had 1,030 employees with offices in California, Arizona and Nevada. Minkow’s stake was worth $100 million.</p><h2>Barry Minkow Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Barry Minkow is one of the <strong>richest Pastor</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Barry Minkow</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Barry Jay Minkow (born March 22, 1966) is a former American businessman, pastor, and convicted felon. While still in high school, he founded ZZZZ Best (pronounced “Zee Best”), which appeared to be an immensely successful carpet-cleaning and restoration company. However, it was actually a front to attract investment for a massive Ponzi scheme. It collapsed in 1987, costing investors and lenders $100 million: one of the largest investment frauds ever perpetrated by a single person, as well as one of the largest accounting frauds in history. The scheme is often used as a case study of accounting fraud.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Minkow and 10 other ZZZZ Best insiders were indicted by a Los Angeles federal grand jury in January 1988 on 54 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, money laundering, embezzlement, mail fraud, tax evasion and bank fraud. The indictment accused Minkow of bilking banks and investors of millions of dollars while systematically draining his company of assets. It also accused Minkow of setting up dummy companies, writing phony invoices and conducting tours of purported restoration sites. Prosecutors estimated that as much as 90 percent of the company’s revenue was fraudulent. On June 16, prosecutors won a superseding indictment charging Minkow with credit card fraud and two additional counts of mail fraud.</p><p>While Minkow admitted to manipulating the company’s stock, he claimed that he was forced to turn the company into a Ponzi scheme under pressure from the organized-crime figures who secretly controlled his company, a story he later admitted was false. On December 14, he was found guilty on all charges. On March 27, 1989, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was also placed on five years’ probation and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution. In sentencing him, U.S. District Court Judge Dickran Tevrizian described Minkow as a man without a conscience. He rejected Minkow’s plea for a lighter sentence as “a joke” and “a slap on the wrist” for someone who had manipulated the financial system. The SEC subsequently banned him from ever serving as an officer or director of a public company again. He served under seven and a half years, most of them at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Barry Minkow height</b> Not available right now.

The accountant who audited the company before it went public did not visit the insurance restoration sites himself. Had he done so, he would have discovered they were mailboxes located throughout the San Fernando Valley. Minkow retained a 53 percent controlling interest, making him an instant millionaire on paper. Going public seemingly offered him a way to cover up his fraudulent activities. Under securities law at the time, he had to retain his personal shares for two years. He planned to sell a million shares to the public in January 1988, believing this would give him enough money to pay everyone off and go completely legitimate.</p><p align=justify>After Minkow’s early release from prison in 1995, he went to work as Pastor of Evangelism at the Church at Rocky Peak in Chatsworth, California. He also became director of the church’s Bible Institute.</p><h2>Who is Barry Minkow Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Barry Minkow</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Barry Minkow celebrates birthday on March 22 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 1997, he became pastor of Community Bible Church in San Diego. Soon after his arrival, a church member asked him to look into a money management firm in nearby Orange County. Suspecting something was amiss, Minkow alerted federal authorities, who discovered the firm was a $300 million pyramid scheme. This was the beginning of the Fraud Discovery Institute, a for-profit investigative firm (which eventually transpired to be a fraud itself). His original targets were penny stock companies, which are often havens for fraud. However, he soon attracted the attention of The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News. He also began appearing on Your World with Neil Cavuto as a fraud expert. Minkow first gained national attention when 60 Minutes aired a profile of him in August 2006. Several Wall Street investors liked what they saw, and sent him enough money to go after bigger targets.
