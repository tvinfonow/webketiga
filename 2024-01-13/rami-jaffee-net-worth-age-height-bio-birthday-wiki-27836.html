He has worked with many artists including The Wallflowers, Pete Yorn, Soul Asylum, Stone Sour, Joseph Arthur and Coheed and Cambria.</p><p>Around 1989, Jakob Dylan and his friend Tobi Miller formed a group called the Apples, playing various clubs in the L.A. area. While waiting in line at Canter’s deli after 2:00 am, Jaffee heard the Apples wanted an organist/pianist, and he was told that Dylan and Miller were then in the Kibitz Room bar attached to Canter’s.

While working with T Bone Burnett, who was producing the band’s next album, Jaffee was frequently called in as a session musician for producers Paul Fox, Matt Hyde and Rick Neigher. Because of this, in 1996 he was credited on albums by Rickie Lee Jones, the Hookers, Leah Andreone and Chalk FarM. At the same time, the Wallflowers released their second album, Bringing Down the Horse, which went quadruple Platinum. The band toured in support of the album, but in 1997, Jaffee and his wife had a daughter, and he left the tour to be with his family for two months. That same year, he performed session work with Everclear, Grant Lee Buffalo, Richie Sambora, Macy Gray, Jeremy Toback, Joe Henry, Melissa Etheridge, Ramsay Midwood and Garth Brooks.</p><h2>Rami Jaffee Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Rami Jaffee is one of the <strong>richest Musician</strong> from United States.

The band’s two familiar label representatives left the label, after which the record company tried to use the Dylan name as a selling point, against the band’s directive. In mid-1993, the label released the band from their contract. Other labels were not interested in signing the band, and Jaffee filled his time by playing gigs with El Vez as well as taking more session work. He kept his interest in the Wallflowers, saying later, “I believe in these songs, and I’m here for the duration because no one is writing songs like these anymore, songs that have room for a Hammond organ and me.”</p><p align=justify>In 2012, Jaffee returned to the Wallflowers, who were coming off a long hiatus. They released the album Glad All Over in 2012 and toured in support of it that year and also in 2013.
