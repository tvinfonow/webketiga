Japanese composer and activist, he was also a keyboard player for the 70’s electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra.&nbsp;For his music to The Last Emperor, 1987, he won an Academy Award and a Grammy Award.</p><p><a href=#>Brian Wilson</a> was featured on his 1989 album Beauty.&nbsp;featured on his 1989 album Beauty.</p><p>Sakamoto entered the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1970, earning a B.A. in music composition and an M.A. with special emphasis on both electronic and ethnic music. He studied ethnomusicology there with the intention of becoming a researcher in the field, due to his interest in various world music traditions, particularly the Japanese (especially Okinawan), Indian and African musical traditions. He was also trained in classical music and began experimenting with the electronic music equipment available at the university, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP. One of Sakamoto’s classical influences was Claude Debussy, who he described as his “hero” and stated that “Asian music heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me. So, the music goes around the world and comes full circle.”</p><p>Sakamoto began his career while at university in the 1970s as a session musician, producer, and arranger. His first major success came in 1978 as co-founder of YMO. He concurrently pursued a solo career, releasing the experimental electronic fusion album Thousand Knives in 1978. Two years later, he released the album B-2 Unit. It included the track “Riot in Lagos”, which was significant in the development of electro and hip hop music. He went on to produce more solo records, and collaborate with many international artists, David Sylvian, Carsten Nicolai, Youssou N’Dour, and Fennesz among them. Sakamoto composed music for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and his composition “Energy Flow” (1999) was the first instrumental number-one single in Japan’s Oricon charts history.</p><p align=justify>One of his daughters,&nbsp;Miu Sakamoto&nbsp;is a J-pop artist.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ryuichi Sakamoto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ryuichi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sakamoto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nakano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tokyo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Akiko Yano</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Miu Sakamoto</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ryuichi Sakamoto ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

After working as a session musician with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi in 1977, the trio formed the internationally successful electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) in 1978. Known for their seminal influence on electronic music, the group helped pioneer electronic genres such as electropop/technopop, synthpop, cyberpunk music, ambient house, and electronica. The group’s work has had a lasting influence across genres, ranging from hip hop and techno to acid house and general melodic music. Sakamoto was the songwriter and composer for a number of the band’s hit songs—including “Yellow Magic (Tong Poo)” (1978), “Technopolis” (1979), “Nice Age” (1980), “Ongaku” (1983) and “You’ve Got to Help Yourself” (1983)—while playing keyboards for many of their other songs, including international hits such as “Computer Game/Firecracker” (1978) and “Rydeen” (1979). He also sang on several songs, such as “Kimi ni Mune Kyun” (1983). Sakamoto’s composition “Technopolis” (1979) was credited as a contribution to the development of techno music, while the internationally successful “Behind the Mask” (1978)—a synthpop song in which he sang vocals through a vocoder—was later covered by a number of international artists, including Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton.</p><h2>Ryuichi Sakamoto Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ryuichi Sakamoto is one of the <strong>richest Composer</strong> from Japan.

The album experimented with different styles, such as “Thousand Knives” and “The End of Asia”—in which electronic music was fused with traditional Japanese music—while “Grasshoppers” is a more minimalistic piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of electronic musical instruments, including various synthesizers, such as the KORG PS-3100, a polyphonic synthesizer; the Oberheim Eight-Voice; the Moog III-C; the Polymoog, the Minimoog; the Micromoog; the Korg VC-10, which is a vocoder; the KORG SQ-10, which is an analog sequencer; the Syn-Drums, an electronic drum kit; and the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which is a music sequencer that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto. A version of the song “Thousand Knives” was released on the Yellow Magic Orchestra’s 1981 album BGM. This version was one of the earliest uses of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, for YMO’s live performance of “1000 Knives” in 1980 and their BGM album release in 1981.</p><p>As his solo career began to extend outside Japan in the late 1980s, Sakamoto’s explorations, influences and collaborators also developed further.
