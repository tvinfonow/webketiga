Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 1980, he appeared in the slasher film Friday the 13th. Some of his early stage work included Getting Out, performed at New York’s Phoenix Theater, and Flux, at Second Stage Theatre during their 1981–1982 season.</p><h2>Kevin Bacon Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kevin Bacon is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actor</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kevin Bacon</b>'s net worth <strong>$45 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He moved to New York at age seventeen to pursue a career in theater. He was soon cast for a role in a production by the Circle in the Square Theater School.</p><p align=justify>His long list of credits in various genres inspired the trivia game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.</p><p align=justify>Bacon, the youngest of six children, was born and raised in a close-knit family in Philadelphia. His mother, Ruth Hilda (née Holmes; 1916–1991), taught at an elementary school and was a liberal activist, while his father, Edmund Norwood Bacon (1910–2005), was an architect who served for many years as executive director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1982, he won an Obie Award for his role in Forty Deuce, and soon afterward he made his Broadway debut in Slab Boys, with then-unknowns Sean Penn and Val Kilmer. However, it was not until he portrayed Timothy Fenwick that same year in Barry Levinson’s film Diner&nbsp;– costarring Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Tim Daly, and Ellen Barkin&nbsp;– that he made an indelible impression on film critics and moviegoers alike.</p><p>Bolstered by the attention garnered by his performance in Diner, Bacon starred in Footloose (1984). Richard Corliss of TIME likened Footloose to the James Dean classic Rebel Without a Cause and the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musicals, commenting that the film includes “motifs on book burning, mid-life crisis, AWOL parents, fatal car crashes, drug enforcement, and Bible Belt vigilantism.” To prepare for the role, Bacon enrolled at a high school as a transfer student named “Ren McCormick” and studied teenagers before leaving in the middle of the day. Bacon earned strong reviews for Footloose. Bacon’s critical and box office success led to a period of typecasting in roles similar to the two he portrayed in Diner and Footloose, and he had difficulty shaking this on-screen image. For the next several years he chose films that cast him against either type and experienced, by his own estimation, a career slump.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Bacon height</b> <strong>5 feet 10 inches</strong> Kevin <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 10 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Bacon left home at age 17 to pursue a theater career in New York City, where he appeared in a production at the Circle in the Square Theater School. “I wanted life, man, the real thing”, he later recalled to Nancy Mills of Cosmopolitan. “The message I got was ‘The arts are it. Business is the devil’s work. Art and creative expression are next to godliness.’ Combine that with an immense ego and you wind up with an actor.” Bacon’s debut in the fraternity comedy National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978) did not lead to the fame he had sought, and Bacon returned to waiting tables and auditioning for small roles in theater. He briefly worked on the television soap operas Search for Tomorrow (1979) and Guiding Light (1980–81) in New York.</p><p align=justify>In 1988, he starred in John Hughes’ comedy She’s Having a Baby, and the following year he was in another comedy called The Big Picture.</p><h2>Who is Kevin Bacon Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kevin Bacon</strong> married to <strong>Kyra Sedgwick </strong>.
