Who is Kylie Minogue dating now & how much money does Kylie Minogue have?</p><h2>Kylie Minogue Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kylie Minogue</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pop Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>May 28, 1968</strong> in Melbourne, <strong>Australia</strong>. Grammy Award-winning pop star who released the biggest Australian hit of the decade, “The Loco-Motion.” She had a comeback in the 2000s with the #1 single “Can’t Get You Out of My Head.” She has also appeared in such films as San Andreas, Holy Motors and Moulin Rouge.</p><p><a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> made her a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2008 for her services to music.</p><p>Kylie Ann Minogue, AO, OBE (/m ɪ ˈ n oʊ ɡ / ; born 28 May 1968), often known simply as Kylie, is an Australian-British singer, songwriter and actress. She is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time and has been recognised with several honorific nicknames, most notably the “Princess of Pop”. Minogue has also been known for reinventing herself in music and fashion throughout her career, being referred to as a style icon.</p><p>A ten-year-old Minogue accompanied Dannii to a hearing arranged by the sisters’ aunt, Suzette, and, while producers found Dannii too young, Alan Hardy gave Kylie a minor role in soap opera The Sullivans (1979). She also appeared in another small role in Skyways (1980). In 1985, she was cast in one of the lead roles in The Henderson Kids. Minogue took time off school to film The Henderson Kids and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry. During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue “fragile” after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be “written off”. In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing “turned out to be the best thing for her”. Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music programme Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20&nbsp;million British viewers. Minogue became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one year and was the youngest recipient of the “Gold Logie” as the country’s “Most Popular Television Performer”, with the result determined by public vote.</p><p align=justify>She has two younger siblings: actress and musician <a href=#>Dannii Minogue</a> and Brendan Minogue. She has been in long term relationships with actor <a href=#>Olivier Martinez</a> and model <a href=#>Andrés Velencoso</a>.

It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad’s records – the Stones and Beatles.” She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. Minogue claimed that she “wanted to be” Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: “She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna&nbsp;… What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.” Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a “product of the Stock, Aitken & Waterman Hit Factory”. Musician Nick Cave, who worked with Minogue in some occasions, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: “He’s definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.” Throughout her career, Minogue’s work was also influenced by Cathy Dennis, D Mob, Scritti Politti, Björk, Tricky, U2 and Pizzicato Five, among others.</p><h2>Kylie Minogue Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kylie Minogue is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from Australia. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kylie Minogue</b>'s net worth <strong>$100 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She acted in several Australian soap operas as a child and gained recognition from her role on Neighbours.</p><p align=justify>She won a Mo Award for Australian Entertainer of the Year. As fashion icon, she partnered with H&M for a line of beachwear, and then launched her own lingerie brand called Love Kylie.</p><p align=justify>Kylie Ann Minogue was born on 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia. Her father, Ronald Charles Minogue, is a fifth-generation Australian and has Irish ancestry; her mother, Carol Ann Jones, came from Maesteg, Wales. Jones had lived in Wales until age ten when her mother and father, Millie and Denis Jones, decided to move to Australia for a better life. Just before Kylie’s birth, Ron qualified as an accountant and worked through several jobs while Carol worked as a professional dancer. Kylie’s younger brother, Brendan, is a news cameraman in Australia, while her younger sister Dannii Minogue is also a singer and television host. The Minogue family frequently moved around various suburbs in Melbourne to sustain their living expenses, which Kylie found unsettling as a child. After the birth of Dannii, the family moved to South Oakleigh. Kylie would often stay at home reading, sewing and learning to play the violin and piano. As money was tight, Ron worked as an accountant at a family-owned car company and Carol worked as a tea lady at a local hospital. After moving to Surrey Hills, Melbourne, Minogue attended Studfield Primary School briefly before attending Camberwell Primary School. She went on to Camberwell High School. During her schooling years, Minogue found it difficult to make friends. She got her HSC (graduated high school) with subjects including Arts and Graphics and English. Minogue described herself as being of “average intelligence” and “quite modest” during her high school years. Growing up, she and her sister Dannii took singing and dancing lessons.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$100 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>1987 Logie Award for Most Popular Actress<br>1988 Logie Award for Most Popular Personality<br>1988 Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Victorian Television<br>1988 Logie Award for Most Popular Actress<br>Nominated – 1987 Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent<br>Nominated – 1989 Logie Award for Most Popular Personality</p><p>During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed “I Got You Babe” as a duet with actor John Waters, and “The Loco-Motion” as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, “The Locomotion”, spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country’s highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year’s highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote “I Should Be So Lucky” while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year’s highest-selling single, and received a “Special Achievement Award”. Minogue’s debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album is a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. It went gold in the United States, while the single “The Locomotion” reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian dance chart. The single “Got to Be Certain” became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song “Especially for You”, which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and, in December 2014, sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as “the Singing Budgie” by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as “standard, late-80s … bubblegum”, but added, “her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kylie Minogue height</b> <strong>5 ft 0 in</strong> Kylie <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Minogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album Aphrodite and said that Minogue’s “slightly nasal, girl-next-door vocals serve her needs perfectly.” According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Kylie “has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions”. In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American recording artist Madonna. Chris True from Allmusic, reviewed her debut Kylie and found her music “standard late-’80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum”, however he stated that she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album Rhythm of Love, from the early 1990s, “The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.” At the time of her third studio album, “She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.” Chris True stated that during her relationship with Michael Hutchence, “her shedding of the near-virginal façade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.”</p><p align=justify>Minogue’s second album, Enjoy Yourself was released in October 1989. It was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand, Asia and Australia and spawned the UK number one singles “Hand on Your Heart” and “Tears on My Pillow”. However, it failed to sell well throughout North America and Minogue was dropped by her American record label Geffen Records. She then embarked on her first concert tour, the Enjoy Yourself Tour, in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia in February 1990. She was also one of the featured vocalists on the remake of “Do They Know It’s Christmas?”. Minogue’s debut film, The Delinquents was released in December 1989. The movie received mixed reviews by critics but proved popular with audiences. In the UK it grossed more than £200,000, and in Australia, it was the fourth-highest grossing local film of 1989 and the highest grossing local film of 1990. From 1989 to 1991, Minogue dated INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.</p><h2>Who is Kylie Minogue Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kylie Minogue</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
