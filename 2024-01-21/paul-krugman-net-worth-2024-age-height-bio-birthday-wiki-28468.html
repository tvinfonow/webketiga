New York Times op-ed columnist and expert in liberal economics who was a consultant to the president Reagan.</p><p>It served as&nbsp;He was <a href=#>Ronald Reagan</a>‘s chief economic advisor during his presidency.’s chief economic advisor during his presidency.</p><p>Paul Robin Krugman (/ˈ k r ʊ ɡ m ə n / ( listen ) KRUUG -mən; born February 28, 1953) is an American economist who is the Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and a columnist for The New York Times. In 2008, Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography. The Prize Committee cited Krugman’s work explaining the patterns of international trade and the geographic distribution of economic activity, by examining the effects of economies of scale and of consumer preferences for diverse goods and services.</p><p>Krugman earned his BA summa cum laude in economics from Yale University in 1974 and went on to pursue a PhD in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled Essays on flexible exchange rates. While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the Central Bank of Portugal for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the Carnation Revolution.</p><p align=justify>He has a second spouse, Robin Wells.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Krugman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Krugman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Albany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anita Krugman, David Krugman</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robin Wells</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Krugman ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Krugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977. He joined the faculty of MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the Reagan White House as a staff member of the Council of Economic Advisers. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at Stanford, Yale, and the London School of Economics.</p><h2>Paul Krugman Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Krugman is one of the <strong>richest Journalist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Paul Krugman</b>'s net worth <strong>$2.5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>In 1974 the year 1974, he completed his studies at Yale University with an economics degree.</p><p align=justify>He is regarded as among the top intellectuals in the country.</p><p align=justify>Krugman was born to a Russian Jewish family, the son of Anita and David Krugman. In 1922, his paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from Brest, Belarus, at that time a part of Poland. He was born in Albany, New York, and grew up in Merrick, a hamlet in Nassau County. He graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore. According to Krugman, his interest in economics began with Isaac Asimov’s Foundation novels, in which the social scientists of the future use a new science of “psychohistory” to try to save civilization. Since present-day science fell far short of “psychohistory”, Krugman turned to economics as the next best thing.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch, as “one of the great economics teachers of all time” and said that he “had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths”. In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, “[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand”. In that same year, Krugman wrote “The Theory of Interstellar Trade”, a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was “an oppressed assistant professor”.</p><p>Krugman has also been influential in the field of international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly but instead end in a sudden speculative attack. Krugman’s paper is considered one of the main contributions to the ‘first generation’ of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Krugman height</b> Not available right now.

Many models of international trade now follow Krugman’s lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption. This way of modeling trade has come to be called New Trade Theory.</p><p align=justify>When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become ‘locked into’ disadvantageous patterns of trade. Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality. Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms. Krugman has usually been supportive of free trade and globalization. He has also been critical of industrial policy, which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations rent-seeking advantages if “strategic industries” can be identified, saying it’s not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.</p><h2>Who is Paul Krugman Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Krugman</strong> married to <strong>Robin Wells</strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Paul Krugman!<p>Krugman’s support for free trade in the 1980s–1990s provoked some ire from the anti-globalization movement. In 1987 he quipped that, “If there were an Economist’s Creed, it would surely contain the affirmations ‘I understand the Principle of Comparative Advantage’ and ‘I advocate Free Trade’.” However, Krugman argues in the same article that, given the findings of New Trade Theory, “[free trade] has shifted from optimum to reasonable rule of thumb … it can never again be asserted as the policy that economic theory tells us is always right.” In the article, Krugman comes out in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in strategic trade policy and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. He also notes that increasing returns and strategic trade theory do not disprove the underlying truth of comparative advantage.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Paul Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Journalist</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Paul Krugman celebrates birthday on February 28 of every year.</p><p align=justify>More recently he has written, in keeping with his long-term support for trade (while emphasizing that it is not the only or even most-important economic issue) that protectionism does not directly cause recessions, but can make economies less efficient and reduce long-term growth. Indeed, if there is a trade war, imports would decrease as much as exports, so employment should not be strongly impacted, at least in the medium to long run. He considers that the United States should not repeat Reagan’s 1981 policy on taxes and quotas on imported products. Even if it does not produce a recession, protectionism would shock “value chains” and disrupt jobs and communities in the same way as free trade in the past. In addition, other countries would take retaliatory measures against US exports. Krugman recommended against the abandonment of NAFTA, because it could cause economic losses and disruptions to businesses, jobs, and communities. He noted that although free trade has harmed some industries, communities, and some workers, it remains a win-win system overall, enriching both parties to the agreement at the national level; a trade war is equivalently negative for the nations involved, even while it may benefit some individuals or industries within each nation.</p><h3>What is Paul Krugman theory?</h3><p>New trade theory Krugman’s explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale.</p><h3>Does Paul Krugman support MMT?</h3><p><b>Krugman sees MMT as saying that fiscal policy can always deliver the “right size” deficit to maintain full employment</b>. He’s challenging that by asserting that you can have any size deficit and still have full employment because the central bank can always establish the “right size” interest rate to get you there.</p><h3>What is mercantilism theory?</h3><p>Mercantilism is <b>an economic practice by which governments used their economies to augment state power at the expense of other countries</b>. Governments sought to ensure that exports exceeded imports and to accumulate wealth in the form of bullion (mostly gold and silver).</p><h3>Who is the founder of the new trade theory?</h3><p>Although aspects of trade with increasing returns had been worked out earlier, especially in work by Avinash Dixit, new trade theory is associated with <b>Paul Krugman</b>‘s work in the late 1970s, developing into what is known as the Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman trade model and the Helpman–Krugman model.</p><h3>What is wrong with modern monetary theory?</h3><p><b>MMT does not address the opportunity costs and distributional consequences of the monetisation of deficits by the central bank</b>, e.g. its impact on asset prices, that may affect both the demand and the supply side of the economy and therefore the inflation constraint, even before full employment is reached.</p>You may read full biography about Paul Krugman from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfpa62uIykqa6fnZa7cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-21%2fpaul-krugman-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28468.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/2024-01-21/rachel-chaleff-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28503.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/2024-01-21/rachel-chaleff-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28503.html>Rachel Chaleff Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/2024-01-21/pablo-ramirez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28484.html>Pablo Ramirez Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/2024-01-21/pablo-ramirez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28484.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
