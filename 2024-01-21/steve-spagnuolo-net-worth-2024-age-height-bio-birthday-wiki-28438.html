These vacancies included, the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, and Detroit Lions,, but Spagnuolo decided to join with the St. Louis Rams, taking over their head-coaching vacancy with a 4-year, $11.5 million contract. Spagnuolo hired Pat Shurmur and Ken Flajole to be the Rams’ offensive and defensive coordinators respectively. Spagnuolo then hired Josh McDaniels to be the team’s offensive coordinator to replace Shurmur, who left for the Browns’ head-coaching job.</p><h2>Steve Spagnuolo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Steve Spagnuolo is one of the <strong>richest Football Coach</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Steve Spagnuolo</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Stephen Christopher Spagnuolo (/s p æ ɡ ˈ n oʊ l oʊ / ; born December 21, 1959) is an American football coach who is the defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He rejoined Andy Reid after being a defensive assistant with him from 1999 to 2006. Spagnuolo has won two Super Bowls as defensive coordinator, one with the New York Giants and one with the Kansas City Chiefs. Following two seasons in New York, he was the head coach of the St. Louis Rams for three seasons, was an assistant with the Baltimore Ravens, had a one-season stint with the New Orleans Saints, and then went back to the Giants as defensive coordinator in 2015. He was named interim head coach after the firing of former head coach Ben McAdoo on December 4, 2017.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On February 7, 2008, he took his name out of consideration for the head coaching position of the Washington Redskins. The same day, the New York Giants made Spagnuolo one of the highest-paid defensive coordinators in the NFL with a new three-year contract, worth roughly $2 million a year.</p><p>On January 19, 2012, Spagnuolo agreed to terms with the New Orleans Saints to become the new defensive coordinator under head coach Sean Payton, choosing this position rather than an offer from the Philadelphia Eagles. However, Payton was subsequently suspended for the season for his alleged role in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal, leaving Spagnuolo to coach the defense without Payton’s input. In 2012, the Saints allowed the most yards for a season of any defense in NFL history en route to finishing 7–9 and missing the playoffs for the first time in four years. Soon after Payton’s suspension ended, Spagnuolo was fired on January 24, 2013.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Steve Spagnuolo height</b> Not available right now.

(He did not incorporate this philosophy during his time in New Orleans however). Spagnuolo uses a 4–3 base defense with a heavy emphasis on multiple blitz packages, including corner and safety blitzes. While defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, he often used a smaller defensive line, with three or even four defensive ends to further pressure the quarterback.</p><h2>Who is Steve Spagnuolo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Steve Spagnuolo</strong> married to <strong>Maria Spagnuolo </strong>.
