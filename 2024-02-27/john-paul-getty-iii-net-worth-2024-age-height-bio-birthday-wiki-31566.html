He spent most of his childhood in Rome while his father headed the Italian division of the Getty family oil business. His parents divorced in 1964 when he was eight years old, and his father married model and actress Talitha Pol in 1966. The family adopted a hippie lifestyle, spending much time in Britain and Morocco during the 1960s. Getty remained in Italy with his mother Gail and attended St. George’s British International School in Rome.</p><p>In early 1972, Getty was expelled from St. George’s after painting offensive six-feet high wording in a hallway of the school, aimed at the school’s headmaster. In July 1971 his stepmother had died of a heroin overdose in Rome, and his father had moved back to the United Kingdom, partly to escape charges of drug possession which he was facing in Italy.

He had considerable artistic talent and reportedly earned a living making jewelry, selling his paintings and cartoons, and appearing in movies as an extra.

The letter read, “This is Paul’s first ear. If within ten days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.” Paul’s health began to decline rapidly as his wound became infected, combined with pneumonia caused by the cold winter temperatures which were descending. His captors were alarmed at this sudden decline and gave him large doses of penicillin to treat the infection, which caused him to develop an allergy to the antibiotic and further affected his health. Getty’s biographer John Pearson attributed his later alcoholism to the large amounts of brandy that he was plied with in the last few months of his captivity to keep him warm and numb his pain.</p><h2>John Paul Getty III Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John Paul Getty III is one of the <strong>richest Entrepreneur</strong> from United States.

Paul Getty, who was once the richest man in the world. While living in Rome in 1973, he was kidnapped by the ‘Ndrangheta, and held for a $17 million ransom. His grandfather was reluctant to pay, but after his severed ear was received by a newspaper, he negotiated payment to $2.2 million, and Getty was released—five months after being kidnapped. Getty soon after developed drug and alcohol addiction, eventually leading to a stroke that left him severely disabled for the rest of his life.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Getty was kidnapped in the Piazza Farnese in Rome at 3 a.m. on July 10, 1973, when he was 16.

She stated that “Paul didn’t want to be kidnapped anymore, but [the kidnappers] were following him.” He was blindfolded, transported, and imprisoned in a cave in Calabria. The kidnappers issued a ransom note demanding $17 million (equivalent to $98&nbsp;million in 2019) in exchange for his safe return, however, the family suspected a plot by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather.</p><p>In 1974, Getty married German Gisela Martine Zacher (née Schmidt) who was five months pregnant.
