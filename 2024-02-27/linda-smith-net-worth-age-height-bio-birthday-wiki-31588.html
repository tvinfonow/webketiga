Who is Linda Smith dating now & how much money does Linda Smith have?</p><h2>Linda Smith Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Linda Smith</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>July 16, 1950</strong> in Penrith, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Linda Smith, born July 16, 1950 in La Junta (Colorado), is a Republican Party member who represented Washington’s 3rd district from 1995 through 1999. She was unsuccessfully nominated by the Republican Party for the U.S. Senate in 1998 and lost to incumbent Democrat Patty Murray.&nbsp;Linda Smith left politics to create Shared Hope International, which is a non-profit organization that rescues and restores women and children in need.&nbsp;Smith has been working around the globe and in the United States for victims of sex trafficking since its inception.</p><p>Smith is known for her anti-abortion stance, her support for campaign finance reform, her maverick tendencies and, most importantly, her vote against Newt Gingrich being confirmed as House Speaker in 1997.&nbsp;Smith was also known for her opposition to gay rights. She considered homosexuality a “morally ineligible inclination.”&nbsp;Smith ran for Washington’s U.S. Senate Seat in 1998 after she gave up her House seat.&nbsp;To face the sitting U.S. Senator, she defeated Chris Bayley, former King County Prosecuting attorney.&nbsp;Patty Murray is the third woman to win the Senate race.&nbsp;Although the election was close to expected, Murray won with a 58% to 42% margin.</p><p>To build momentum in the international anti-trafficking movement, Smith also founded the War Against Trafficking Alliance (WATA) in January 2001. WATA coordinates both regional and international efforts necessary to combat sex trafficking. In February 2003, WATA co-sponsored a World Summit with the U.S. Department of State, which brought together non-government and government leaders from 114 nations, all demonstrating a sustained commitment to prosecuting trafficking, providing assistance to victims, and building regional strategies to protect the vulnerable from the sex trade. In 2005, WATA was invited to participate, along with UNIFEM, in the first ASEAN conference to address child sex tourism in East and Southeast Asia.</p><p>As an expert on trafficking, Linda has spoken out against the trafficking of women and children in numerous Congressional hearings and in national and international forums, such as the World Conference on Trafficking, Congressional Hearing on the International Violence Against Women Act along with Ambassador Melanee Verveer and UNIFEM Goodwill Ambassador Nicole Kidman, and the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission on the Protection of Children. At the Helsinki Commission Hearing in 2006, Smith testified about the Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) in America. Linda has appeared on CNN, MSNBC, USA Today, Dan Rather Reports, ABC News, the Dr. Phil Show, O’Reilly Factor, and CBN. Linda received the 2009 Soroptimist Making a Difference for Women Award and the 2010 Soroptimist Ruby Award: For Women Helping Women. Linda has been published in news outlets and journals around the world; including The New York Times, the Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, the International Review of Penal Law, and the Regent University Law Review.</p><p align=justify>Smith’s political career began in 1983, when she won a special election against a Democratic Party incumbent and was elected to the Washington House of Representatives.&nbsp;She was elected to the Washington state Senate in 1987. This gave Republicans control over the chamber. Smith remained there until her supporters launched a September 1994 write-in campaign.&nbsp;Smith, despite being called the “Hazel Dell Housewife”, launched a 19-day-long grassroots campaign which saw her defeat the only Republican candidate on the primary ballot.&nbsp;After securing a Republican nomination ballot line through her September write in campaign, Smith defeated Jolene Unsoeld, a liberal three-term Democrat, in November.&nbsp;In 1996, she narrowly defeated Brian Baird (Democrat) by 113 votes.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Linda Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Linda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Penrith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Linda Smith ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The hopeless faces of desperate women and children forced into prostitution compelled her to found Shared Hope International (SHI), a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating sex-trafficking. Since Smith’s retirement from Congress, she has devoted all her energy to this cause, traveling around the world to prevent, restore and bring justice to victims of trafficking. Shared Hope supports shelter and service creation for sex trafficking survivors using a comprehensive model for restoration.
