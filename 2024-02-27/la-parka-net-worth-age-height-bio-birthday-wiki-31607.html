Who is La Parka dating now & how much money does La Parka have?</p><h2>La Parka Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>La Parka</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Wrestler</strong> who was born on <strong>November 14, 1965</strong> in Mexico, <strong>Mexico</strong>. Masked professional wrestler/luchador from Mexico who had a long, successful career. His real name was Adolfo Tapia.</p><p>He teamed with Diamond Dallas Page to pull a trick on The Macho Man <a href=#>Randy Savage</a> in the ring.</p><p>While working for CMLL La Parka was allowed to also wrestle for independent promotions in Mexico, the US and Japan. During his time on the independent circuit L.A. Park developed a long-running and very intense feud with El Hijo del Santo and Blue Demon Jr., interjecting himself in a storyline that played off the original rivalry between El Santo and Blue Demon creating a feud that headlined various shows all over Mexico and involves three of the most famous masks of the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>Adolfo Tapia made his professional wrestling debut in 1982 at the age of 16, using his real name. Later on he would wrestle as the masked El Gringo in the Monclova, Coahuila region and as El Minero in Mexico City. Tapia lost his first Lucha de Apuesta, or bet match, to Climax II and was forced to take off the El Minero mask and reveal his real name, as per Lucha libre traditions. In 1988 he changed his ring character to El Asesino de Tepito (“The Assassin from Tepito”), a rudo (villain) character he used in 1988. He lost the Asesino de Tepito mask in an Apuesta match against Astro de Oro at some point in 1988. Following the mask loss Tapia adopted a character called Principe Island (“Island Prince”), a character he would use until 1992. As Principe Island he won the masks of wrestlers Gran Cóndor, Principe Judas, Guerrero Negra and Bestia Negra I. On November 21, 1987 he lost the Principe Island mask to El Hijo del Santo. Following his mask loss he started working as the masked Invasor del Norte I as well as still taking bookings as Principe Island. The double bookings came to an end on June 26, 1991 when Stuka unmasked the Invasor del Norte character, revealing that Tapia played both characters.</p><p align=justify>His brother Eustacio Jimenez Ibarra also became a professional wrestler.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>La Parka</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>La</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Parka</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Raymundo Ibarra, Camila Ibarra Banda</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>El Hijo de Cien Caras</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>El Hijo de L.A.

Initially Peña and La Parka did not clash over the use of the La Parka name since Tapia worked mainly for various US independent promotions and for smaller Mexican promotions. When Tapia signed a contract with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), AAA’s main rival, in 2003 Peña took legal actions against Tapia. He renamed “La Parka Jr.” and had a court order drawn up that prevented Tapia from being billed as “La Parka” in Mexico, claiming that Peña had the copyright to the character. The legal battle between Tapia and AAA forced Tapia to change his name to “L.A. ParK”, short for “La Autentica ParK” (K pronounced as “Ka”). In subsequent years both parties filed various legal petitions to stake their claims on the copyright. For a period of time Tapia was barred from appearing on television wearing the black and white outfit he had worn for years. This led to Tapia wearing a modified version of the outfit in other color combinations such as black and red, black and yellow, white and black or even variations of silver. He had already modified the original “La Parka” outfit to differentiate between himself and the AAA version, adopting a mask that looked less like a skull and more like the face of Darth Maul from the Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace movie. Later on Tapia would return to wearing the black and white outfits once again.</p><h2>La Parka Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>La Parka is one of the <strong>richest Wrestler</strong> from Mexico.

La Parka often wrestled against other AAA Luchadors such as Juventud Guerrera or Super Caló and often teamed with Psicosis (known in WCW as Psychosis). Due to La Parka’s more comedic style he stood out from the rest of the AAA wrestlers who were generally high fliers. He was nicknamed “the chairman of WCW” due to the fact that he often carried a chair to the ring, play air guitar on it during his entrances and generally use it both in matches and in post match celebrations. At one point he and Psychosis were managed by Sonny Onoo, although the team failed to achieve much success as a unit. He later dropped Onoo as a manager and begin to feud with Psychosis and Disco Inferno. While La Parka often wrestled on WCW’s Monday Nitro show his PPV appearances were rare. On July 13, he teamed with Psychosis and Villano IV on the undercard of WCW’s Bash at the Beach PPV, losing to Héctor Garza, Juventud Guerrera and Lizmark Jr. He also wrestled at SuperBrawl VIII, losing to Disco Inferno.</p><p>La Parka’s biggest achievement in WCW did not even involve Adolfo Tapia. One night in a match against Randy Savage, La Parka suddenly executed Diamond Dallas Page’s finisher, the Diamond Cutter on Savage and gained the pinfall. After the match “La Parka” unmasked to show that it was Savage’s rival Diamond Dallas Page under the mask, using the ruse to get back at Savage. A couple of weeks later, Savage wrestled against the real La Parka defeating him to gain a small measure of revenge. In October 1998, La Parka became part of Eddie Guerrero’s Latino World Order (LWO), a group that also included Psychosis, Juventud Guerrera, Villano IV, Villano V, El Dandy, Silver King, Héctor Garza, Damián 666, and a reluctant Rey Mysterio Jr. The group feuded mainly with Konnan and Perry Saturn. In January 1999, Guerrero was injured in a car accident and the LWO group was subsequently abandoned.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>La Parka height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> La <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1992 Antonio Peña founded a new wrestling promotion called Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), signing Tapia to a contract early on. Peña came up with the idea to repackage Tapia as “La Parka” (an altered spelling of La Parca, Spanish for “The Reaper”, a character who wore a full bodysuit and mask that resembled a skeleton like the ones used in Mexico’s Day of the Dead ceremonies. The character was an almost instant success with the fans, the imagery combined with Tapia’s charisma and flamboyant actions in the ring made him a big crowd favorite despite La Parka initially being a rudo character. One of his initial storyline feuds was with Lizmark, a feud that resulted in a match for the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship at AAA’s inaugural Triplemania event, in which Lizmark successfully defended the title against La Parka. In August 1993 La Parka won his first championship when he defeated Lizmark for the WWA Light Heavyweight Championship on a WWA/AAA co-promoted show. The title reign lasted until October 23, 1993 when Lizmark won the title back. The feud between the two saw La Parka defeat Lizmark for the WWA title for a second time on June 20, 1994. La Parka was one of the wrestlers that worked the When Worlds Collide show, a joint AAA/World Championship Wrestling (WCW) pay-per-view where he teamed with Jerry Estrada and Blue Panther, losing to the team of The Pegasus Kid, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Tito Santana. On September 9, 1994 La Parka won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship that he had been chasing for over a year when he defeated Lizmark for the title, finishing off the storyline between the two. La Parka held the title for 200 days losing it to Jerry Estrada. La Parka would wear the Mexican National Light Heavyweight championship two further times while working for AAA, in 1995 and in 1996 until he lost the belt to Pimpinela Escarlata on May 13, 1996. In 1995 he would make an appearance for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the United States, teaming with Psicosis, losing a tag team match against Konnan and Rey Misterio Jr.</p><p align=justify>In 2003 L.A. ParK began working for CMLL, although he was often kept off their television broadcasts due to the ongoing legal battles with Peña and AAA. In January 2004 L.A. Park teamed up with Shocker to defeat Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. Guerrero and Bucanero regained the titles 56 days later, after which L.A. Park challenged Último Guerrero to defend the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against him at CMLL’s 71st Anniversary Show, a match which L.A. Park lost two falls to one.</p><h2>Who is La Parka Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>La Parka</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
