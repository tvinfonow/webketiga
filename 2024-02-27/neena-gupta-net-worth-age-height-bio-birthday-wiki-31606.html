Indian actress, best known for her role as Savitri in Meri Biwi Ki Jawab Nahin (2004).&nbsp;She has also been seen in Gandhi, Khal Nayak and Veere Di Marriage, as well as The Threshold.</p><p>In the 1980s, she was in a relationship to actor&nbsp;Alok Nakh.</p><p>Neena Gupta (born 4 July 1959) is an Indian actress and television director. Known for her work in both art-house and commercial films, she won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a young widow in Woh Chokri (1994). In 2018, she saw career resurgence for starring as a middle-aged pregnant woman in the comedy-drama Badhaai Ho, for which she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.</p><p>Gupta has made appearances in several international films, such as Gandhi (1982), in which she played the niece of Mahatma Gandhi, and Merchant Ivory films, The Deceivers (1988), Mirza Ghalib (1989) In Custody (1993), and Cotton Mary (1999). She also made an impression in Indian parallel cinema such as Mandi (1983), Rihaee (1988), Drishti (1990) and Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda (1992). These performances further established her profile in Indian movies alongside her arthouse film contemporaries Rekha, Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil and Dimple Kapadia. Despite this, Gupta never had a major commercial hit and found it difficult to find more dramatic roles: “I made a few mistakes in the beginning of my career. I didn’t have anybody to guide me. I didn’t have a secretary. I didn’t call up directors, or meet people asking for roles. Also, because of the media, there is a perception that I am a strong woman. Unfortunately, in our society, that goes against you. So, I got negative, vampish roles only. Plain and simple female roles never come my way because of my image, which is very wrong. My personal life got typecast into my professional life.”</p><p align=justify>In 2008, she married Vivek Mehra, a businessman.&nbsp;Masaba Gupta is her daughter and a fashion designer.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Neena Gupta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Neena</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gupta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Delhi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>R.
