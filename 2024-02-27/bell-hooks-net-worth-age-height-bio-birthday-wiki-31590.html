American writer, feminist and social activist, whose actual name was Gloria Jean Watkins.&nbsp;The book she wrote was “Ain’t I a Woman? : Black Women and Feminism”.</p><p>They as well as&nbsp;She and <a href=#>Julie Burchill</a> are both well known feminist authors.&nbsp;are two of the most well-known feminist writers.</p><p>Watkins was born in Hopkinsville, a small, segregated town in Kentucky, to a working-class family. Her father, Veodis Watkins, was a custodian and her mother, Rosa Bell Watkins, was a homemaker. She had five sisters and one brother. An avid reader, she was educated in racially segregated public schools, and wrote of great adversities when making the transition to an integrated school, where teachers and students were predominantly white. She later graduated from Hopkinsville High School in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.

She adopted her maternal great-grandmother’s name as a pen name because her great-grandmother “was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [she] greatly admired”. She put the name in lowercase letters “to distinguish [herself from] her great-grandmother.” She said that her unconventional lowercasing of her name signifies what is most important is her works: the “substance of books, not who I am.”</p><p align=justify>She was born into an upper-middle class family, with five sisters and a brother.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bell Hooks</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hooks</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Activist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hopkinsville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kentucky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bell Hooks ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In this book, she argues that those voices have been marginalized, and states: “To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body.” She argues that if feminism seeks to make women equal to men, then it is impossible because in Western society, not all men are equal. She claims, “Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined women’s liberation as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status.”</p><p>In her 1994 book Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, hooks writes about a transgressive approach in education where educators can teach students to “transgress” against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom. To educate as the practice of freedom, bell hooks describes it as “a way of teaching that anyone can learn.” Hooks combines her practical knowledge and personal experiences of the classroom with feminist thinking and critical pedagogy. Hooks investigates the classroom as a source of constraint but also a potential source of liberation. She argues that teachers’ use of control and power over students dulls the students’ enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, “confin[ing] each pupil to a rote, assembly-line approach to learning.” She advocates that universities should encourage students and teachers to transgress, and seeks ways to use collaboration to make learning more relaxing and exciting. She describes teaching as a performative act and teachers as catalysts that invite everyone to become more engaged and activated. Performative aspect of learning “offers the space for change, invention, spontaneous shifts, that can serve as a catalyst drawing out the unique elements in each classroom.” Hooks also dedicated a chapter of the book to Paulo Freire, written in a form of a playful dialogue between herself, Gloria Watkins and her writing voice, bell hooks. In the last chapter of the book, hooks raised the critical question of eros or the erotic in classrooms environment. According to hooks, eros and the erotics do not need to be denied for learning to take place. She argues that one of the central tenets of feminist pedagogy has been to subvert the mind-body dualism and allow oneself as a teacher to be whole in the classroom, and as a consequence wholehearted.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bell Hooks height</b> Not available right now.

In the decades since its publication, Ain’t I a Woman? has gained widespread recognition as an influential contribution to feminist thought.</p><p align=justify>In 2004, 10 years after the success of Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks published Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope. In this book, hooks offers advice about how to continue to make the classroom a place that is life-sustaining and mind expanding, a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and student together work in partnership. She writes that education as a practice of freedom enable us to confront feelings of loss and restore our sense of connections and consequently teaches us how to create community. She locates hope in places of struggle where she witnessed individuals positively transforming their lives and the world around them. For hooks, educating is always a vocation rooted in hopefulness.</p><h2>Who is Bell Hooks Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bell Hooks</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
