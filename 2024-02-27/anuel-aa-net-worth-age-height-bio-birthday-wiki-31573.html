Who is Anuel AA dating now & how much money does Anuel AA have?</p><h2>Anuel AA Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Anuel AA</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>November 27, 1992</strong> in Carolina, Carolina, <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>. Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago (born 26 November 1992), known professionally as Anuel AA, is a Puerto Rican rapper and singer. He is considered a pioneer of the Latin trap movement. He won the 2019 Billboard Latin Music Award for New Artist of the Year. He is also seen as a controversial figure in the Latin music scene for his legal troubles and feuds with fellow Puerto Rican rappers Cosculluela, Residente and Ivy Queen.</p><p>In April 2016, Anuel AA was arrested in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico and sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for illegal possession of three firearms. Billboard noted that Latin trap surged in popularity while Anuel AA was in prison, writing, “Anuel remained behind bars, while outside, his music flourished.” After being arrested and imprisoned, he recorded his debut album while incarcerated. He did this by primarily recording his vocals over the phone and taking advantage of his mandatory stay at a Miami halfway house to complete the album.</p><p>On September 15, 2018, Anuel AA released a diss track called “Intocable” aimed at fellow rapper Cosculluela. The track was widely criticized due to its profanity and remarks about homosexuality and HIV/AIDS patients. In the song, he refers to transgender model and television host La Taína as a “pig” for her HIV-positive status. Due to the public backlash, Anuel AA’s concert at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico venue scheduled for October 12 of that year was canceled by his production staff and main producer Paco López. Anuel AA later issued an apology for the song. He explained, “It is the worst mistake of my career. I do not need this and I apologize to all the people I offended. To homosexuals, to people with AIDS, to La Taina [the model] and to those who lost everything after Hurricane Maria … My fans deserve from me to be a better person, and I apologize to everyone in Puerto Rico.”</p><p>According to XXL, Anuel AA is considered “one of the founding fathers of Latin trap music”. He is noted for his signature “BRRR” adlib, which is meant to mimic the sound of an automatic firearm. Anuel AA’s lyrics often discuss sex, crime, and life on the streets. Paul Simpson of Allmusic described his lyrics as “too risqué to be played on the radio” and highlighted that his success has instead stemmed from streaming services and the artist’s highly active social media presence. Gary Suarez of Vice viewed his 2018 album Real Hasta la Muerte to be a collection of both “gleaming trap bangers” and “reggaeton crowd pleasers”. Despite his “bad guy image”, Suarez wrote that the relationship-themed songs “Culpables” and “Secreto” represent “a softening of his hardened trapero persona”. Anuel AA is additionally noted for his use of the word “bebecita” (“baby”) in songs and on social media, and the word has become associated with the reggaeton genre as well as Anuel AA and Karol G’s relationship.</p><p align=justify>Anuel AA was arrested and held in the Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo on April 3, 2016, with three companions when police found three pistols including one stolen, nine magazines, and 152 bullets. He signed a plea deal for 30 months in federal prison for gun possession charges. Following his arrest, the #FreeAnuel movement became popular among his fans as he continued to release tracks from prison. Being able to record his voice over the phone, Anuel AA mostly participated in collaborations with other artists such as Nicky Jam, Cosculluela, Bad Bunny and J Balvin.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anuel AA</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anuel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anuel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1992</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Puerto Rico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Anuel AA ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
