Outfielder who made his MLB debut with the Washington Nationals in 2019 at the age of 19. He helped the Nationals win their first-ever World Series Championship in 2019.</p><p>He became the youngest player since <a href=#>Ken Griffey Jr.</a> to be intentionally walked in a game in May 2018.</p><p>Soto made his first major-league start the next day, playing left field in a game against the San Diego Padres at Nationals Park, and on the first pitch of his first plate appearance of the game, got his first major-league hit, a 422&nbsp;ft (129&nbsp;m) opposite-field three-run homer off of Robbie Erlin. After rounding the bases and returning to the dugout, Soto stepped back out for a curtain call from the crowd. He became the youngest player in franchise history to hit a home run and the first teenager to homer in a major-league game since Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper did it at age 19 in 2012. “He’s a special player,” Harper said of Soto after the game. Soto became the youngest major league player since Ken Griffey Jr. in 1989 to be intentionally walked in a game when Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter elected to do so rather than give him an opportunity to drive in a run on May 29.</p><p>With the Nationals trailing the Milwaukee Brewers 3–1 in the bottom of the eighth during the NL Wild Card Game, Soto hit a bases-clearing single off of Brewers closer Josh Hader to give the Nationals a 4-3 lead. They would later hang on to the lead and advance to the National League Division Series.</p><p align=justify>He was born and raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. His father, Juan Sr., was also a standout baseball player.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Juan Soto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Juan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1998</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Santo Domingo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dominican Republic</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Belkis Pacheco, Juan Jose Soto</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Juan Soto ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

At the time of his injury, he was batting .360 with three home runs in 23 games with the Suns. In July 2017, MLB Pipeline ranked Soto the Nationals’ second-best prospect and the 42nd-best among all prospects. Soto did not return to the Suns in 2017, but he had two rehabilitation stints with the Gulf Coast Nationals, one of five games in July 2017 and a second one of four games in September 2017 before injuring his hamstring and finally being shut down for the season. In those nine games with the Gulf Coast League Nationals, he went 8-for-25 (.320) with a double, a triple, and four RBIs, and finished the 2017 season with a batting average of .351, three home runs, and 18 RBIs.</p><h2>Juan Soto Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Juan Soto is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from Dominican Republic.

Dubbed the “Soto Shuffle”, the routine includes Soto swinging his hips, wiping the dirt with a wide arc of his leg, pulling at his crotch, and lowering himself into a squat and staring down the pitcher. As an ESPN writer describes it: “He’ll swing his hips or spread his legs or sweep his feet or shimmy his shoulders or lick his lips or squeeze his, um, junk, sometimes all at once”. Soto says he started the routine in the minor leagues “to get in the minds of the pitchers, because sometimes they get scared”. In Game 1 of the 2019 National League Championship Series, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Miles Mikolas responded to Soto’s antics by grabbing his own crotch after retiring Soto on a ground out. Soto responded later by saying, “He got me out, he can do whatever he wants.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Juan Soto height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Juan <strong>weight</strong> <strong>220&nbsp; lbs</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>220&nbsp; lbs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Soto signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in July 2015. He made his professional debut in 2016 with the Gulf Coast League Nationals in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League and was named the Gulf Coast League Most Valuable Player after hitting .368 with five home runs and 32 runs batted in (RBIs). In September 2016 he was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League for the final few games of the 2016 season. Appearing in six games for the Doubledays, he went 9-for-21 (.429) with three doubles and an RBI. He finished the 2016 season with an overall batting average of .368, five home runs, and 32 RBIs.</p><p align=justify>On June 2018, shortly after being called up to the major leagues, Baseball America listed Soto as the Nationals’ top prospect, overtaking fellow outfielder Víctor Robles, and the fourth-best overall prospect in baseball. Soto contributed to a notable oddity when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees on June 18, 2018. The contest began on May 15, 2018, but was suspended until June 18 due to inclement weather with the score at 3–3. Since the stoppage occurred in the fifth inning, a team would have been awarded the win if they were ahead, which implied that he had technically hit a home run before his MLB debut. To prevent confusion, it was added in sequence to his already accrued home run total as his sixth home run. He had hit three home runs in his first five plate appearances against the Yankees.</p><h2>Who is Juan Soto Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Juan Soto</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
