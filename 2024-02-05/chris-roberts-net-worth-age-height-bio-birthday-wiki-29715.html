Who is Chris Roberts dating now & how much money does Chris Roberts have?</p><h2>Chris Roberts Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Chris Roberts</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Celebrity</strong> who was born on <strong>May 27, 1968</strong> in Redwood City, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Best known for his work on such popular video games as Star Citizen, Freelancer, Starlancer, and Wing Commander, this designer worked for Origin Systems and later established production companies called Digital Anvil and Cloud Imperium Games Corporation.</p><p>He directed a 1999 movie version of his Wing Commander video game. The film, neither a popular nor a critical success, starred <a href=#>Freddie Prinze, Jr.</a></p><p>Roberts returned to the United States in 1986. He found a job at Origin Systems, where he created Times of Lore, published in 1988. The game’s interface had a strong influence on other Origin products such as the popular Ultima series. A similar game system was used in Roberts’s next release for Origin, Bad Blood (1990).</p><p>Wing Commander was published later in 1990 and was highly acclaimed. Wing Commander (and the franchise it spawned) soon became Origin’s most successful product. Roberts wasn’t as heavily involved in the sequel Wing Commander II, which he only produced. He instead concentrated on Strike Commander. First shown to the public at Summer CES 1991, the project suffered from numerous delays and was not released until 1993. He returned to Wing Commander soon after, devising the original concept for the spin-off Wing Commander: Privateer (which his brother, Erin Roberts, produced) and being more deeply involved in Wing Commander III and Wing Commander IV. For these sequels, Roberts directed the live-action cinematic scenes. Roberts’s major role in developing the Wing Commander games led Next Generation to name him one of their “75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995”.</p><p align=justify>Though born in northern California, he was raised in Manchester, England. In the mid 1980s, he returned to the United States.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris Roberts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roberts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Game Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Redwood City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Erin Roberts</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sandy Gardiner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chris Roberts ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Developed jointly between Warthog and Digital Anvil, the game was produced by the Roberts brothers, and Eric Peterson. The company was acquired by Microsoft soon after, who sold two of Digital Anvil’s projects, Conquest: Frontier Wars led by Eric Peterson, and Loose Cannon led by Tony Zurovec to Ubisoft. Roberts left the company after the acquisition, abandoning the director position of his ambitious project Freelancer, although he remained with the game in a consulting role for a while. The game was commonly regarded as vaporware due to its promised release date of 2001 however it was eventually released in 2003 with a markedly different feature set than the initial plans. It was received very favorably with a Metacritic score of 85%.</p><p>After leaving Digital Anvil, Roberts founded Point of No Return Entertainment, planning to produce films, television and games. However, no projects materialized from Point of No Return. Roberts founded Ascendant Pictures in 2002 and served as a producer for a number of Hollywood productions including Edison, Timber Falls, Outlander, Who’s Your Caddy?, The Big White, Ask the Dust, Lucky Number Slevin and Lord of War. In 2005, actor Kevin Costner sued Ascendant Pictures for breach of contract on an unreleased film. The company was acquired by Bigfoot Entertainment in 2010.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Chris Roberts height</b> Not available right now.

He cited disillusionment with working with large development teams and Origin parent company Electronic Arts’ unwillingness to give substantial funding to games that weren’t sequels. The fledgling studio set up shop in Austin and for several years worked quietly, inking a publishing deal with Microsoft in 1997.</p><h2>Who is Chris Roberts Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chris Roberts</strong> married to <strong>Sandy Gardiner</strong>.
