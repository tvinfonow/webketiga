Who is Alicia Myers dating now & how much money does Alicia Myers have?</p><h2>Alicia Myers Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Alicia Myers</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Songwriter</strong> who was born on <strong>November 20, 1957</strong> in Detroit, Michigan, <strong>United States</strong>. Myers was born Alicia Myers on November 20, 1957, in Detroit, Michigan, to Lawrence and Margaret Myers, as one of their nine children. Her older brother, Jackie Myers, also a musician, would later become part of the beach band Chairman of the Board. The two siblings competed in a local talent competition in April 1968 at Detroit’s Martin Luther King Jr. High School, where they sang, “Ain’t Nothing Like the Real Thing”, originally performed by Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell, and they were awarded first place. She attended Lee University for her collegiate studies.</p><p>Universal Special Products re-released her debut Alicia album, with the same exact track listing, as Don’t Stop What You’re Doin’ in 1986, without further chart success.</p><p>She is a survivor of childhood tuberculosis. She later survived breast cancer in 1998 and has since become an advocate for the disease.</p><p>In 2011, Myers released her first album of new material in 27 years, entitled Peace of Mind.</p><p align=justify>After her stint in the band, she started her solo music recording career in 1981, with the release of Alicia by MCA Records,. This album achieved a Billboard magazine R&B Albums chart peak of No. 41 and featured two of her biggest hits, “I Want To Thank You” and “Don’t Stop What You’re Doin'”. Her follow-up album, Alicia Again, released later the same year, failed to chart. Her subsequent album, I Fooled You This Time appeared the following year under the same label, and it surpassed the R&B Album chart placement of Alicia, reaching number 27. The high charting success of I Fooled You can be attributed to the inclusion of the aforementioned “I Want To Thank You,” which had gained popularity due to DJs such as Tee Scott playing it in heavy rotation, where it was discovered by those who missed it the previous year upon its initial release. Her fourth album, 1984’s I Appreciate became her highest-charting album on the R&B chart, peaking at number 12, while also heralding her only appearance on The Billboard 200, where it peaked at No. 186. I Appreciate would be her last album of newly-recorded material released in the 1980s.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alicia Myers</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alicia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Myers</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Detroit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alicia Myers ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
