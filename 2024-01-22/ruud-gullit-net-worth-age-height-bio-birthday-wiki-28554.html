A Dutch forward, midfielder, and defender who helped AC Milan win three Serie A title titles and two European Cups between 1987 and 1993.&nbsp;He was the Dutch Footballer-of-the-Year in 1986 and 1987, and won the 1987 Ballon d’Or. He also was a member the Dutch national football team from 1981 through 1994.</p><p>After retiring, he went to TV and was able to interview prominent figures in both sports and politics like&nbsp;He went into TV after retiring, getting to interview notable figures in sports as well as politics, such as <a href=#>Nelson Mandela</a>..</p><p>Gullit developed his football skills in the confines of the Rozendwarsstraat, and street football was instrumental in his formative years. Gullit’s first team were the Meerboys, where he joined as a junior in 1970. At the age of ten, however, Gullit moved from the Jordaan to Amsterdam Old West where he played street football alongside Frank Rijkaard. Gullit joined the DWS club after his move, and came to the attention of the Dutch youth team, where he played alongside future full international teammates, Erwin Koeman, Ronald Koeman and Wim Kieft.</p><p>In 1978, Gullit signed professionally for HFC Haarlem under coach and former West Bromwich Albion player Barry Hughes. Gullit made 91 league appearances for Haarlem, scoring 32 goals. He made his debut for the club at just 16 years old, becoming at the time the youngest player in the history of the Eredivisie. In his first year at Haarlem, the club finished bottom of the Eredivisie, but bounced back the following season winning the Eerste Divisie. Gullit was named as the best player in the Eerste Divisie that season. In the 1981–82 season, Gullit was in fine form as Haarlem finished fourth and qualified for Europe for the only time in their history. In that same season, Gullit scored the goal he would later consider his finest: “Playing against Utrecht I went past four defenders and then the goalkeeper, and scored. It was an unforgettable goal for me.” Hughes was so impressed with the young Gullit that he described him as the “Dutch Duncan Edwards”.</p><p align=justify>His father was a teacher and his mother worked in a nearby museum.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ruud Gullit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ruud</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gullit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Holland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Netherlands</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ria Dil, George Gullit</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Estelle Cruijff , Cristina Pensa , Yvonne de Vries</strong></td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Maxim Gullit, Joëlle Gullit, Quincy Gullit, Cheyenne Gullit, Charmayne Gullit, Felicity Gullit</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ruud Gullit ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Neill later told that he considered £30,000 too much for “this wild kid”. Gullit therefore moved to Feyenoord in 1982, where he made 85 league appearances, scoring 31 goals. At Feyenoord, Gullit found himself playing alongside Dutch legend Johan Cruyff, while the assistant manager was Wim van Hanegem, and they were to leave a lasting impression.</p><h2>Ruud Gullit Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ruud Gullit is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from Netherlands.

Gullit was named Dutch Footballer of the Year in recognition of his contribution to Feyenoord’s success. At Feyenoord, Gullit occupied an increasingly advanced role in midfield, having played predominantly as a sweeper at Haarlem. While at Feyenoord, Gullit became the focus of a race row as manager Thijs Libregts was alleged to have referred to Gullit as “blackie” and criticised him for being lazy, though Libregts defended himself by claiming that it was merely a nickname. While playing for Feyenoord at St Mirren in September 1983, he was racially abused and spat on by supporters of the Scottish club. Gullit called it “the saddest night of my life”.</p><p>There was further frustration in 1985 when the Dutch missed out on qualification for the World Cup at the hands of neighbours Belgium in a play-off. Having lost 1–0 in Belgium, the Netherlands appeared to be set for qualification in Rotterdam as they led 2–0 until a late Georges Grün goal put Belgium through on away goals.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ruud Gullit height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Ruud <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1981, on his 19th birthday, Gullit made his international debut as a substitute for the Netherlands national team against Switzerland, a game the Dutch lost 2–1. During his early international career, the team failed to qualify for both the 1982 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1984 – missing out on the latter tournament on goals scored as Spain, needing an 11-goal victory to qualify, trounced minnows Malta 12–1 in their final qualifying game.</p><p align=justify>Silvio Berlusconi signed Gullit for Milan in 1987, paying the then world record transfer fee of 18&nbsp;million guilders as a replacement for Ray Wilkins. Among his teammates at that club were compatriots Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, along with Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi.
