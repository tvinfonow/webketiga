Auerbach was given more playing time at third in 1979 after Pete Rose’s departure through free agency.&nbsp;Although he was still a thorn in his former team, it became personal when he was swept aside by the Dodgers’ May 25 17-6 defeat of the Reds.&nbsp;Lopes hit a 3-0 fastball to score three runs for the Dodgers, who were already leading 14-2.&nbsp;Auerbach deemed that unsporting and an immediate brawl broke out.&nbsp;He went 3-for-5 on June 27 with three doubles, and two RBIs in Reds’ 9-1 win over the Dodgers.</p><p>Auerbach was the Brewers’ starting shortstop in 1971, but he lost his job after the June 1 San Francisco Giants acquisition of Bob Heise.&nbsp;His batting average was below.200 and he had more strikes than hits (between 30 and 28), Auerbach was sent to Triple A at the close of June.&nbsp;After a brief stint of three games in August, he returned to the majors and showed some improvement in September.&nbsp;He hit.229 in September and scored his first home run against Diego Segui of the Oakland Athletics to lead his team towards a 1-0 win.</p><p>Twelve games into the 1973 season, Auerbach was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Tim Johnson. With Bill Russell firmly entrenched at the shortstop position, Auerbach spent the season in triple A with the Albuquerque Dukes. After the season, the Brewers purchased Auerbach back from the Dodgers. A month later, the Dodgers purchased Auerbach back from the Brewers.</p><p>Backing up Russell at short and Davey Lopes at second, and occasionally pinch hitting, Auerbach saw very limited playing timein 1974, but batted .342 in his limited role. He reached the post season for the first time in his career, and got a double in his only at bat in the 1974 National League Championship Series.</p><p align=justify>He started the 1970 season playing for Clinton (now an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers).&nbsp;He slugged.325 in the first month and then made the leap to Triple A where he tallied an even.300.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick Auerbach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Auerbach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Woodland Hills</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rick Auerbach ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
