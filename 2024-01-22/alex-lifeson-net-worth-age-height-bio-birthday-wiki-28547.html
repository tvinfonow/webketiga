He had a Fender Stratocaster with a Bill Lawrence humbucker and Floyd Rose vibrato bridge as backup “and for a different sound.” For the A Farewell to Kings sessions, Lifeson began using a Gibson EDS-1275 for songs like “Xanadu” and his main guitar became a white Gibson ES-355. During this period Lifeson used Hiwatt amplifiers. He played a twelve-string Gibson B-45 on songs like “Closer to the Heart.”</p><h2>Alex Lifeson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Alex Lifeson is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Alex Lifeson</b>'s net worth <strong>$35 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His parents gave him viola lessons as a child, which he hated. His father bought him a guitar for Christmas when he was twelve.</p><p align=justify>He can play the mandolin and bouzouki.</p><p align=justify>Alexandar Živojinović, OC (born 27 August 1953), better known by his stage name Alex Lifeson, is a Canadian musician, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the guitarist of the progressive rock band Rush. In 1968, Lifeson co-founded the band that would become Rush, with drummer John Rutsey and bassist and singer Jeff Jones. Jones was replaced by Geddy Lee a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by Neil Peart in 1974.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$35 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During live Rush performances, Lifeson used MIDI controllers that enabled him to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds from digital samplers and synthesizers, without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used Moog Taurus Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates shared a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members used these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound “events” that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).</p><p>From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson’s name, who was the producer of Grace Under Pressure. He would start using them again twenty years later. He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion and an Ovation Adamas acoustic/electric guitar. By 1987, Lifeson switched to Signature guitar despite describing them as “awful to play—very uncomfortable–…had a particular sound I liked.” Lifeson primarily used PRS guitars in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of Roll The Bones in 1990/1991. He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of Counterparts, Test for Echo and Vapor Trails as well as the R30 tour.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Alex Lifeson height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Alex <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name in the 1973 Canadian documentary film Come on Children.</p><p align=justify>While the bulk of&nbsp;Lifeson’s work in music has been with Rush, his first major outside work was his solo project, Victor, released in 1996. Victor was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. Victor is attributed as the artist as well as the album title). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson’s name. The title track is from the W.&nbsp;H. Auden poem, also entitled “Victor”. Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by Sarah McLachlan, was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records’ lack of support for the first album.</p><h2>Who is Alex Lifeson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Alex Lifeson</strong> married to <strong>Charlene Lifeson </strong>.
