American writer and lecturer whose focus is on spirituality as well as self-improvement.&nbsp;Her works published are A Return to Love, A Woman’s Worth, and The Gift of Change.</p><p>Her name was a hit after her appearance as a guest on The&nbsp;She gained fame through appearing on The <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> Show.&nbsp;Show.</p><p>On July 30, Williamson participated in the second primary debate. She spoke for eight minutes and 52 seconds. Despite placing 19th in speaking time, she was the most Googled candidate in 49 of 50 states and received the fourth-most attention on Twitter. The spike in searches was prompted by her reference to the Flint water crisis (which she described as a “part of the dark underbelly of American society”) and her assertion that President Trump was harnessing a “dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred” which she later described as racism, bigotry, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and xenophobia propelled by social media.</p><p>Williamson said that her lack of elective office experience does not disqualify her from being president. She implies that not having held office before is, in part, what makes her uniquely qualified. She stated that the belief that only experienced politicians can lead the U.S. is “preposterous”, arguing that experienced politicians led the U.S. into unfounded wars, extreme income inequality and environmental harm. She has called for her expertise in empathy, differentiated thinking, and political vision to be valued on par with elected experience and cited President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1932 statement that “The Presidency is not merely an administrative office. That’s the least of it… It is preeminently a place of moral leadership”:</p><p align=justify>She was raised living in Houston, Texas.&nbsp;Following a stint in California for a number of years, she returned to her home state of Texas.&nbsp;Single parent and a child called India Emmaline.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marianne Williamson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marianne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Williamson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Self-Help Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Houston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>India Emmaline</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Marianne Williamson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Marianne Williamson</b>'s net worth <strong>$2 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She attended Pomona College in Claremont, California and was an instructor for The Unity Church.&nbsp;She later established a Los Angeles meals-on-wheels-program for AIDS patients called Project Angel Food.</p><p align=justify>She is the creator of The Peace Alliance, a campaign to support the creation of the US Department of Peace.</p><p align=justify>Where I’m coming from is not that I have a ‘Black agenda.’ I have an American agenda”. […] The reason I want reparations, as opposed to simple race-based policies, [is because] race-based policies leave open the question whose fault it is that this gap even exists. And race-based policies provide justice, but it doesn’t provide the power that capital provides, and that is really what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about an economic gap that existed in 1865, that was actually increased with another 100 years. So after 200 years of slavery, you had another 100 years of institutionalized violence against black people in America. My point –– reparations carry more than the power of purely financial restitution. They carry moral force. We need to deal with these things on a deeper, more transformative level. This should not be considered “cuckoo.” This should not be considered “wacky.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Self-Help Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Later that month, Williamson participated in the first primary debate. She spoke for four minutes and 58 seconds, placing her 17th in speaking time of the 20 candidates. The LA Times wrote that Democratic voters were “confused” and “transfixed” by Williamson, who declared that her first act as president would be to call New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and say, “Girlfriend, you are so on”, a reference to Ardern’s emphasis on building a country that treats its children well.</p><p>Williamson attended Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School. After graduating, she spent two years studying theater and philosophy at Pomona College in Claremont, California, where she was a roommate of film producer Lynda Obst. In 1973, Williamson—an active antiwar protester—dropped out of college and lived “a nomadic existence” during what she calls “her wasted decade.” She moved to New Mexico, where she took classes at the University of New Mexico and lived in a geodesic dome with her boyfriend. She broke up with her boyfriend a year later and moved to Austin, Texas, where she took classes at the University of Texas. After leaving Texas, she went to New York City, intending to pursue a career as a cabaret singer, but got distracted by “bad boys and good dope.” Vanity Fair wrote that Williamson “spent her twenties in a growing state of existential despair”. In New York, Williamson suffered from deep depression following the end of a relationship. She has said that this experience gave rise to a desire to spend the rest of her life helping people.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Marianne Williamson height</b> Not available right now.
