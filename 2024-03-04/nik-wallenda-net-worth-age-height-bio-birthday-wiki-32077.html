They have been performing balance acts with no nets ever since Karl Wallenda made the family famous during the 20th century.&nbsp;Nik Wallenda is a direct descendant of Karl Wallenda, who he describes as his role model and “biggest hero in life”.&nbsp;Many members of the Wallenda family have been killed when they were performing or training.&nbsp;The troupe was killed in 1962. group’s famous seven-person pyramid fell down and killed two family members as well as his uncle Mario.&nbsp;In 1978 his grandpa Karl Wallenda died after falling from a rope at the age of 73 at the age of 73 in Puerto Rico.</p><p>Nikolas Wallenda (born on 24 January 1979) is an American Acrobat, aerialist high wire artist, daredevil and writer.&nbsp;He is famous for his high-wire shows with no safety net.&nbsp;He holds 11 Guinness World Records for various Acrobatic feats, but was most famous for being one of the pioneers to step on on a tightrope across Niagara Falls.&nbsp;Wallenda was the first person to walk 1,800 feet on an iron cable that crossed Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua, the longest of his walks on the 4th of March 2020.</p><p>Wallenda is a seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family, and he participated in various circus acts as a child. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13, and he chose high-wire walking as his career in 1998 after joining family members in a seven-person pyramid on the wire. In 2001, he was part of the world’s first eight-person high-wire pyramid. He performed with his family at various venues from 2002 to 2005, forming his own troupe in 2005. He performed with Bello Nock in 2007 and 2008 in a double version of the Wheel of Steel that he helped invent. In 2009, he set new personal bests for highest and longest tightrope walks, completing a total of 15 walks above 100 feet (30&nbsp;m) in the air that year.</p><p>In 1999, Wallenda proposed to his future wife Erendira (née Vasquez, from famous Mexican circus family) on a wire 30 feet (9.1&nbsp;m) high during a performance in Montreal, Quebec. Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked to the middle of the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. A week later, they were married. “I don’t know if either of us could be married to someone who didn’t perform”, says Erendira. “I can’t see either of us ever being happy sitting behind a desk.”</p><p align=justify>Wallenda was born in Sarasota, Florida on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer.&nbsp;His parents purchased him an swing set at the age of two.&nbsp;Before Troffer was even done putting together the set, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar, and then did an aerial leap.&nbsp;At the same time Wallenda began to perform with his family members in their circus show.&nbsp;The first time he performed in public took place on the SeaWorld stage in San Diego in 1981.&nbsp;He started playing on the wire at the age of two moving back and forth being held by his mother’s hands.&nbsp;At the age of four, he began walking the wire independently, and was learning mostly through his father.&nbsp;It was common for him to play with the parents’ wire for practice along with his older sister Lijana at a distance of two feet from the ground.&nbsp;The parents were known to throw things at him when the kid practiced and fired him with a BB gun in order to teach him how to handle distractions.&nbsp;At the age of six, he visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that he would like to walk on a tightrope the falls.&nbsp;He spent the majority of his life in the open as an RV as his parents travelled across America.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nik Wallenda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wallenda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Acrobat</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sarasota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Delilah Wallenda, Terry Troffer</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lijana Wallenda</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Erendira Wallenda</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Evita Wallenda, Yanni Wallenda, Amadaos Wallenda</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nik Wallenda ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

They also toured the United States as part of various circuses. One early act featured Wallenda riding a motorcycle across the high-wire 30 feet (9.1&nbsp;m) in the air.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Nik Wallenda</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Wallenda was not shaky or stumble even a bit in his walk, neither did he stop for any additional tricks during the walk (as is his usual practice).&nbsp;While speaking with ABC journalists live when he began the final stage of his journey, he confessed “I’m drained … My hands are going numb. I feel like I’m getting weak.”&nbsp;He later added that “my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before”, and attributed it to the stress of the day.&nbsp;In the final moments the show, he stopped and fell down on one knee, and then blew an ode towards the crowd.&nbsp;He stood up, pumped his fist, then completed the final few steps.&nbsp;He crossed the bridge around 10.41 p.m. (EDT), just 25 minutes after he began.&nbsp;As a result, Wallenda became the first person to walk directly through Niagara Falls on a high-wire.&nbsp;The 1800s saw several tightrope walkers crossed Niagara Falls on the Niagara Gorge down river, however, none had traversed directly across the Falls.&nbsp;Wallenda also set the world record for the longest hike over an waterfall.&nbsp;Prior to Wallenda the last person who crossed the river by the tightrope was James Hardy in 1896.&nbsp;According to Wallenda this was the longest tightrope walk without support walk ever recorded.&nbsp;He carried his passport along on the journey and was required to show his passport in front of Canadian border guards waiting to greet the arrival of Wallenda to the Canadian side of the falls.</p><p align=justify>In the afternoon, Wallenda went outside to perform the Wheel of Death off the roof and across the the 23rd floor of the Casino.&nbsp;The act involved him was within the wheel for approximately 10 times, before he went up on top of it, where he was able to walk and jump rope around the wheel.&nbsp;In the course of the show, he was with his eyes closed.&nbsp;The show set a new World Record for the highest elevation at that the Wheel has ever been performed.&nbsp;Also, it was the first time that anyone could perform the stunt on the roof of a structure.</p><p align=justify>Wallenda briefly considered becoming a doctor, and was accepted into college. However, his plans changed in 1998 when he participated in a re-creation of Karl Wallenda’s seven-person pyramid on the high-wire in Detroit, alongside his father, mother, and other family members.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Acrobat</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The double Wheel of Steel was invented by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up together in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before coming up with the double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock’s backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was to find a way to split the wheels while they were still spinning. “There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments”, Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like pneumatic cylinders. Wallenda’s uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce.</p><p>In 2006, McDonald’s sponsored a show in Detroit. To promote the restaurant’s new coffee, Nik Wallenda and his older sister Lijana did an act where they met in the middle of a high-wire and sat down to have some coffee, after starting on opposite ends. After exchanging several toasts, Nik stood up and stepped over his sister. As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire. After Nik descended to the ground, a crane was moved to reduce the tension on the wire and he rode a hook up to rescue his sister.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Nik Wallenda height</b> Not available right now.

After five months of four hours per day, six days a week preparation, the family successfully walked across a 30-foot-high (9.1&nbsp;m) tightrope in six minutes, setting a Guinness World Record. Nik Wallenda cited Karl Wallenda as the primary inspiration for the feat, and stated that “it was a landmark experience for our profession, as well as our family and me personally”.</p><p align=justify>In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a featured performer in the Ringling Brothers production Bellobration, performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double version of the Wheel of Steel. At the beginning of the act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39&nbsp;feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.</p><h2>Who is Nik Wallenda Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Nik Wallenda</strong> married to <strong>Erendira Wallenda </strong>.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Nik Wallenda celebrates birthday on January 24 of every year.</p><p align=justify>On October 15, 2008, Wallenda performed on a live broadcast of Today. The plan was to walk and then bicycle off the roof of the Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135&nbsp;feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the 250-foot-long (76&nbsp;m) cable with a 45-foot (14&nbsp;m) balancing pole. Halfway through, he sat down on the wire and called the Today show hosts. “Where are you?” he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show’s hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. “I actually slipped”, he said later. “I lost focus there for a moment” because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.</p><h3>Is Nik Wallenda still performing?</h3><table readability=2><tr>Nik Wallenda</tr><tr readability=4><td>Occupation</td><td>Acrobat, daredevil, high wire artist</td></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1992–present</td></tr></table><h3>How many Wallendas have fallen and died?</h3><p>Carla Wallenda left the family act in 1961 to form her own troupe.
