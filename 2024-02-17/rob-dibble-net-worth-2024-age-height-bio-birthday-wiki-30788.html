Who is Rob Dibble dating now & how much money does Rob Dibble have?</p><h2>Rob Dibble Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Rob Dibble</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Baseball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>January 24, 1964</strong> in Bridgeport, Connecticut, <strong>United States</strong>. Robert Keith Dibble, born January 24, 1964, is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB), pitcher and television analyst.&nbsp;Dibble was a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds (now Chicago White Sox), Milwaukee Brewers (now Milwaukee Brewers) between 1988 and 1995.&nbsp;He was a two-time All-Star and had 89 saves in his career.&nbsp;Dibble played many roles in broadcasting sports television after he retired as a player.</p><p>He was an MLB All-Star in 1991 and 1990, and was also the 1990 NLCS Most Valuable Player (alongside fellow “Nasty Boy”, Randy Myers).&nbsp;The Reds won the World Series in 1990 by defeating the Oakland Athletics in 4 consecutive games.</p><p>In 1998, Dibble joined ESPN as a baseball analyst, working mostly on Dan Patrick’s radio show. He worked on The Best Damn Sports Show Period as a co-host until 2008, when he left to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on XM Channel 175/Sirius channel 210. He formerly hosted The Show (on the same channel) with Jody McDonald. Dibble served as co-analyst (with Kevin Kennedy) for FOXSports.com on a weekly video segment entitled “Around the Bases.” Dibble also is a co-host with former Major League player Denny Hocking on Fox Sports Radio Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract to replace Don Sutton as the color voice of the Washington Nationals on MASN.</p><p>While broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals crowd, and questioning their focus on the game. He later apologized for the comments. Later in the month, Dibble criticized Nationals rookie pitcher Stephen Strasburg for missing a start due to an injury: “Suck it up, kid. This is your profession. You chose to be a baseball player. You can’t have the cavalry come in and save your butt every time you feel a little stiff shoulder, sore elbow.” It was revealed shortly afterward that Strasburg had torn an elbow ligament and required Tommy John surgery. Dibble took a few days off from MASN after making the comments, and on September 1, 2010, MASN announced that Dibble would no longer be calling Nationals games. After losing his job with the Nationals, Dibble apologized for the Strasburg comments on his radio show.</p><p align=justify>In the eighth inning, Dibble struck out three batters with nine pitches on June 4, 1989. This was in a 5-3 victory over the San Diego Padres.&nbsp;Dibble is one of 90 pitchers in Major League history to accomplish the nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning, a feat known as an immaculate inning.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob Dibble</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dibble</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bridgeport</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jonna Dibble , Joanne Abate</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rob Dibble ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
