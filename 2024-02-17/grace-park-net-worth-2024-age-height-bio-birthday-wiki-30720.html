CBS claimed that they had given “unprecedented” salary raises to Park and Kim, suggesting that they had been paid a lot less under their old contracts. Some critics noted that the network’s “refusal to pay Kim and Park on matching terms with O’Loughlin and Caan was CBS’s formal declaration that they were determined to protect a disparity that has been a sore point since the show’s premiere: The assertion was that O’Loughlin and Caan are Hawaii Five-0 “stars” with Kim and Park being merely “co-leads” or supporting cast”, yet Kim and Park were originally featured heavily on advertising and proved to be a crucial part of the show’s success.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Grace Park height</b> <strong>5′ 9″</strong> Grace <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5′ 9″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2004, Park married real estate developer Phil Kim.
