The Pez dispenser was invented in 1948 and Pez was repositioned as a fruit flavored candy. <b>The dispensers are still manufactured in Austria, as well as Slovenia and China</b>, in factories that are owned and operated by Pez.</p><h3>Are Pez worth anything?</h3><p>But nearly all Pez without feet bring at least $10 or more. And, <b>one in three from the 1960s are worth $100</b>. If you have a “Make-a-Face” Pez on its original card you can put a whopping $2,500 in your pocket.</p><h3>What Pez is worth the most?</h3><p>One of the rarest of all Pez Disney dispensers is <b>Mary Poppins</b>, which released in 1973 and has no “feet.” There are two variants, one with painted cheeks and one without. The non-painted version is worth around $750, while the model with some blush will put some more green in (or out of) your pocket.</p><h3>What does PEZ taste like?</h3><p>In the United States, PEZ flavors come in all the usual fruity suspects: <b>orange, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, mango, and lemon</b> (via PEZ). There’s also a cola flavor, a peppermint sugar-free variety, and a fizzy version that is reminiscent of Pop Rocks.</p>You may read full biography about Pez from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfpbK7ecyuqqKbmZa7cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-02-17%2fpez-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30744.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/2024-02-17/prestonplayz-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30768.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/2024-02-17/prestonplayz-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30768.html>PrestonPlayz Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/2024-02-17/party-favor-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30757.html>Party Favor Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/2024-02-17/party-favor-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-30757.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
