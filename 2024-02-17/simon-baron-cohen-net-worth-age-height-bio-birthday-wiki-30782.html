Leslie and Uta Frith) of the first study proposing a correlation between children with autism and delays in the development of a theory of mind (“ToM”). A theory of mind is the ability to imagine other people’s emotions and thoughts, and it is a skill that according to Baron-Cohen’s research is typically delayed developmentally in children with autism.</p><p>Baron-Cohen and his colleagues discovered in 1987 the first evidence that experiences in synaesthesia remain consistent over time; they also found synaesthesia to be measurable via neuroimaging techniques. His team has investigated whether synaesthesia is connected to autism.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=6.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Simon Baron-Cohen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ridgle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Judith Baron Cohen, Vivian Baron Cohen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ash Baron-Cohen, Dan Baron Cohen, Suzannah Baron Cohen, Aliza Baron Cohen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bridget Lindley</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sam Baron, Kate Lindley-Baron, Robin Lindley-Baron, Kate Baron</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Simon Baron-Cohen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Simon Baron-Cohen</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Simon Baron-Cohen FBA FBPsS (born 15 August 1958) is a British clinical psychologist and professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge. He is the Director of the University’s Autism Research Centre and a Fellow of Trinity College. In 1985, Baron-Cohen formulated the mind-blindness theory of autism, the evidence for which he collated and published in 1995. In 1997, he formulated the fetal sex steroid theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015. He has also made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex differences, autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and technical ability, and synaesthesia. However, his views on autism and sex differences, such as the fetal sex steroid theory, are controversial, with some critics asserting that Baron-Cohen’s theories are based on subjective perceptions.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1997 Baron-Cohen developed the empathising–systemising theory. His theory is that a cognitive profile with a systemising drive that is stronger than empathising is associated with maths, science and technology skills, and exists in families with autism spectrum disorders. He suspects that if individuals with a “systemising” focus are selecting each other as mates, they are more likely to have children with autism. He postulates that more individuals with autistic traits are marrying each other and having children. He said that “In essence, some geeks may be carriers of genes for autism: in their own life, they do not demonstrate any signs of severe autism, but when they pair up and have kids, their children may get a double dose of autism genes and traits. In this way, assortative mating between technical-minded people might spread autism genes.”</p><p>In 2001 he developed the autism-spectrum quotient, a set of fifty questions that can be used to help determine whether or not an adult exhibits symptoms of autism. The AQ has subsequently been used in hundreds of studies including one study of half a million people, showing robust sex differences and higher scores in those who work in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Simon Baron-Cohen height</b> Not available right now.

She died of breast cancer in 2016.</p><p align=justify>Baron-Cohen’s work in systemising-empathising led him to investigate whether higher levels of fetal testosterone explain the increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among males; his theory is known as the “extreme male brain” theory of autism. A review of his book The Essential Difference published in Nature in 2003 summarises his proposal as: “the male brain is programmed to systemize and the female brain to empathize&nbsp;…&nbsp;Asperger’s syndrome represents the extreme male brain”.</p><h2>Who is Simon Baron-Cohen Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Simon Baron-Cohen</strong> married to <strong>Bridget Lindley </strong>.
