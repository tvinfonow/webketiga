Who is Alex Baptiste dating now & how much money does Alex Baptiste have?</p><h2>Alex Baptiste Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Alex Baptiste</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Association Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>January 31, 1986</strong> in Sutton in Ashfield, Sutton in Ashfield, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Alexander Aaron John Baptiste (born 31 January 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for League One club Doncaster Rovers.</p><p>On 1 July 2008, Baptiste agreed a deal to join Championship club Blackpool. Speaking about the move, he described it as a “great opportunity and challenge”. He started the season as a regular in the Seasiders’ reserve team, and for the first few months of the season he was not named in the first-team squad. He made his first-team debut on 22 November 2008 against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux at right-back. He scored his first goal for the Seasiders in a 1–1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road on 14 February 2009. Three days later he was named in the Football League’s “Championship Team of the Week”.</p><p>Baptiste cemented his place in the starting line up in the latter stages of the 2008–09 season, playing either centre back or right back. On 20 January 2010, after 27 appearances and two goals in the 2009–10 season, Baptiste signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract until June 2013. He said of the new contract: “I am very pleased. I had a good chat with the gaffer and Thommo and the direction of the club is upwards and I want to be a part of it.” Blackpool manager Ian Holloway expressed his belief that Baptiste can play in the Premier League: “Baps has played at left-back, right-back and centre-back and he has been different class. I believe he can play in the Premiership and I have told him that. I am working on the areas that he needs working on, but as a defender I don’t think I have had a better one and I am delighted he has signed.”</p><p>Baptiste played in the Championship play-off final against West Ham United in May 2012, which was won by West Ham 2–1. After the match Baptiste was vocal in his criticism of West Ham’s style of football saying “They just hoof it, and hope for the best”.</p><p align=justify>Born in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, Baptiste came up through the youth team at Mansfield Town. He was originally a central midfielder before gradually dropping back into defence and made his first-team debut aged 17 against Barnsley in April 2003.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex Baptiste</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sutton in Ashfield</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sutton in Ashfield</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alex Baptiste ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
