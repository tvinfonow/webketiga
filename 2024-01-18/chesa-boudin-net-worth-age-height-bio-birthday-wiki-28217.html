Since January 8, 2020, he is the district attorney of San Francisco, having won the 2019 election.</p><p>When Boudin was 14 months old, his parents were arrested for murder in their role as getaway car drivers in the Brink’s robbery of 1981 in Rockland County, New York. His mother was sentenced to 20 years to life and his father to 75 years to life for the felony murders of two police officers and a security guard. After his parents were incarcerated, Boudin was raised in Chicago by adoptive parents Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who, like his parents, had been members of the Weather Underground. Boudin did not learn to read until age 9, a phenomenon common to children of incarcerated parents.

After law school, from 2011 to 2012, Boudin served as a law clerk to M. Margaret McKeown on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He was a 2012–2013 Liman Fellow at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office, and in 2013 and 2014, he served as a clerk to Charles Breyer on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In 2015, Boudin began working full time at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office as a deputy public defender. While there, he argued on behalf of the office’s clients that California’s bail system is unconstitutional, leading to the landmark decision In re Kenneth Humphrey, in which the state’s First District Court of Appeals held that judges must give consideration to a defendant’s ability to pay before setting bail. Boudin also serves on the board of the Civil Rights Corps, a national non-profit organization, and is on the board of Restore Justice, a non-profit based in California.</p><h2>Chesa Boudin Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Chesa Boudin is one of the <strong>richest Lawyer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Chesa Boudin</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>On January 26th, Boudin suspended the process of prosecuting Jamaica Hampton, a man who was shot and seriously injured in an altercation with police, during which he was captured in body camera footage striking an officer with a liquor bottle, in San Francisco’s Mission District. This was characterized in some press reports as “dropping charges”, however Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the DA’s office, stated that charges had not yet been filed. The DA’s office would therefore retain the right to resume the prosecution at a later time. The decision to suspend the process in January was made in order to avoid a conflict between the prosecution of Hampton, and the investigation and potential prosecution of the officer, who may potentially be charged for the shooting. The police union, which opposed Boudin’s election, criticized the decision as “giving criminals a green light” to attack police officers.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Boudin translated Understanding the Bolivarian Revolution: Hugo Chávez Speaks with Marta Harnecker into English, co-edited Letters From Young Activists: Today’s Young Rebels Speak Out, and co-wrote The Venezuelan Revolution: 100 Questions – 100 Answers.
