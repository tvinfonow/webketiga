Popular as an Bollywood actress as well as a playback vocalist, she received the Filmfare Best Female Playback Award for her performance in the film Nikaah and then went to be a part of Salma (1985), Paanch Fauladi (1988), Gehra Raaz (1996) and a myriad of other Indian films.</p><p>She co-starred alongside&nbsp;She co-starred with <a href=#>Rajesh Khanna</a> in the 1985 movie Oonche Log.&nbsp;in the film Oonche Log.</p><p>Salma Agha had a long time relationship in the 1980s with London-based businessman Ayaz Sipra. This relationship lasted many years, during which time Salma made her film debut, but it did not develop into marriage. Apart from this relationship, Salma has been married three times. Her first husband was Javed Sheikh, with whom she had a rather brief and childless marriage in the 1980s. After divorce from Javed Sheikh, Salma Agha married famous squash player Rahmat Khan in 1989. They have two children together – Sasha Agha and Liaqat Ali Khan. Salma and Rahmat Khan got divorced in 2010, and in 2011, Salma Agha got married for a third time. Her present husband, Manzar Shah, is a Dubai-based businessman. Salma Agha lives in Mumbai, where her daughter Sasha is trying to gain a foothold in Bollywood films. Meanwhile Salma’s latest husband, Manzar Shah, lives in Dubai.</p><p>According to Agha, her ancestors were in the film industry during pre-partition days. It is true, she said, that they settled in Pakistan after the partition of India, and that is reason why she, Salma, was born in Karachi, but her mother’s foster-father was a Hindu by birth who had converted to Islam only to marry her grandmother. Her daughter Sasha Agha is born and resides in India. She did not address the point that Sasha’s father, Rahmat Khan, was undoubtedly a Pakistani and had represented his country in innumerable international squash tournaments. Nevertheless, in January 2017, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh announced that Salma Agha would be granted Overseas Citizenship of India, given only to foreign citizens of Indian origin. This will facilitate her travel and residence in India without applying for a visa each time, and without periodically reporting to police during her stay (as required of Pakistanis and some other foreign nationals).</p><p align=justify>Her wedding to Pakistani squash star Rahmat Khan gave birth to the badminton player son Liaqat Ali Khan and an actress and singer daughter named&nbsp;Sasha Agha.&nbsp;After divorcing Khan, Salma Agha married Manzar Shah.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Salma Agha</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Salma</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Agha</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Karachi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sindh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nasreen, Liaquat Gul Agha</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jahangir Khan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Zara Khan, Ali Agha Khan</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Salma Agha ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Liaqat Gul Agha was a tradesman dealing in rugs and belonged to a Urdu speaking Muslim Pathan family based in Amritsar. She traces the origin of her surname ‘Aagha’, “My father (Liaqat Gul Tajik) traded in precious stones and antiques in Iran. He was given the title Aagha there, a kind of knighthood bestowed on a businessman of repute.” Her mother Nasreen (born as Zarina Ghaznavi) was the daughter of Rafiq Ghaznavi, a Pashtun musician, and his wife Anwari Bai Begum, who was one of the earliest actresses of Indian cinema, starring in Heer Ranjha (1932). Anwari and Rafiq Ghaznavi were divorced (or separated) after Zarina/Nasreen’s birth, and Anwari then married a rich Hindu businessman named Jugal Kishore Mehra. In order to marry Anwari, Jugal Kishore Mehra abandoned not only his family but also his religion; he became a Muslim and took the name Ahmed Salman. Since Anwari had a child, Jugal Kishore Mehra effectively became the father of the infant Zarina/Nasreen.</p><h2>Who is Salma Agha Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Salma Agha</strong> married to <strong>Jahangir Khan </strong>.
