Jackson as the title character. In an interview with Eastern Kicks, Lowenthal said that what he liked about Jinno was that he “starts off as one guy and ends up in a very different, very very dark place. Plus I got to kick Sam Jackson’s ass. And they keep bringing him back from the dead for me to play again. And he’s a twin-sword-wielding insane cyborg death machine with a giant teddy bear head. What’s not to like?” He also said that they recorded the voicing for Afro Samurai separately so he did not get to meet Jackson personally until a release party for the related video game years later. Luke Carroll of Anime News Network described Lowenthal’s voicing as a “good performance” but “not enough to make it more than an average dub at best”. Dennis Amith of J-ENT! thought the voice acting was well done. Lowenthal would reprise the role in the 2009 feature Afro Samurai: Resurrection. Steve Fritz of Newsarama wrote “The action sequencing is still top notch, and the vocal performances from Jackson, [Lucy] Liu, Lowenthal and company is on the money.”</p><h2>Yuri Lowenthal Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Yuri Lowenthal is one of the <strong>richest Voice Actor</strong> from United States.
