Former NFL quarterback selected to the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft.</p><p>He was on the same team with USC with the legendary&nbsp;He was teammates at USC with the one and only <a href=#>Reggie Bush</a>..</p><p>Booty prepped at the Evangel Christian Academy in Shreveport, Louisiana but left a year early after his father (who was the team’s quarterback coach) left the staff, having already earned enough credits to graduate. Despite leaving after his junior year, Booty’s final passing stats were 8,474 yards on 555 of 864 attempts (64.2%) with 88 touchdowns and 26 interceptions. Booty succeeded his brother, former Louisiana State University quarterback Josh Booty, and former Miami quarterback Brock Berlin. In 2001 and 2002 he led Evangel Christian Academy to state-championship game victories held at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.</p><p>Although he entered USC as a highly regarded quarterback prospect, Booty spent his first three years at USC as the back-up to eventual Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart, who had replaced former Heisman winner Carson Palmer. When he arrived at USC, the competition for the starting quarterback in the 2003 season had not seen any particular player separating himself from the pack, so when Matt Leinart was eventually chosen as the starter there was some question as to whether he would merely hold the starting position until Booty could learn the offense. Booty earned the spot as the number two quarterback as a freshman, but had to redshirt his second season after suffering an elbow injury in August 2004. When Leinart opted to stay for his final year at USC, there were questions as to whether Booty would transfer to a different school. He opted to remain at USC. Booty had back surgery to repair a bulging disc in his spine at the end of March 2006, but fully recovered and earned the starting spot for the 2006 season.</p><p align=justify>He got married to his wife, Jill in July of 2009; his elder brother,&nbsp;He married his wife, Jill, in July 2009; his older brother, <a href=#>Josh Booty</a>, was a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns and the Oakland Raiders.&nbsp;was a quarterback in his team, the Cleveland Browns and the Oakland Raiders.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John David Booty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Booty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1985</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shreveport</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sonya Booty, Johnny Booty</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Josh Booty, Abram Booty</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jill</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John David Booty ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
