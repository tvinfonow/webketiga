She is a member of the Democratic Party and a member of the United States House of Representatives for Florida’s 7th congressional district, having defeated incumbent John Mica in 2016. The district includes much of downtown and northern Orlando, as well as all of Winter Park, Maitland, Sanford and Altamonte Springs.</p><p>Murphy ran in a district that was somewhat bluer than its predecessor after a court-ordered mid-decade redistricting. The old 7th had been a marginal district, even though Mica had won it twice without serious difficulty (he had previously represented a more Republican St. Augustine/Daytona Beach/Orlando district from 1993 to 2013). Mitt Romney narrowly won it over Barack Obama in 2012, with 51 percent of the vote. In contrast, had the redrawn 7th existed in 2012, Obama would have won it with 49.4 percent.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephanie Murphy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bastable</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ho Chi Minh City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vietnam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sean Murphy</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephanie Murphy ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Murphy stated that the current ban on gun-violence research was “un-American to its core.” As of February 2018, the Act had not been voted on. Following the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, several Republican Congress members indicated that they were in favor of the Gun Violence Research Act. In March 2018, Murphy said that gun control might be approaching “a tipping point” because the present younger generation “had to grow up where they don’t know anything but school mass shootings. They’re sick and tired of it, and they’re activating.”</p><h2>Stephanie Murphy Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Stephanie Murphy is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from Vietnam.
