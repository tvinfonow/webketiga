From early on, he was intent on sounding original, and often tried to “make the guitar not sound like a guitar”. He worked to develop a guitar style that included other-worldly and atmospheric sounds by the use of an EBow. He typically has used a Telecaster guitar, HH amplifiers and Marshall 4×12 cabinets for his stage gear. Later in his career, he relied heavily on the Fernandes Sustainer system to achieve sounds similar to the EBow.</p><p>After nearly five years of recording and performing, Bauhaus broke up and Ash put together Tones on Tail with Bauhaus drummer Kevin Haskins. As Ash described them: “We were a motley crew of individuals who essentially wanted to sound like a band from Venus or Mars!” In 1984, Tones on Tail was disbanded; Ash founded Love and Rockets in 1985 with Haskins and David J, also of Bauhaus. In an interview in June 2009, Ash emphatically stated that he had no further plans to play with Love and Rockets.</p><p align=justify>His family is from Northampton, England.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel Ash</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ash</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Northampton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Daniel Ash ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
