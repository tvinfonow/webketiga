The New York Times’ s Jon Pareles described her music as “perch[ing] prettily tinkling keyboards and concise pop choruses amid the slow, ominous basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop – a candy-coated variation on the dirges of Lorde and Lana Del Rey”, and described her voice, which has been classified as mezzo-soprano by Keaton Bell of the Red Dirt Report, as “whispery, sardonic, tearful, [and] furious”. Billboard’ s Jason Lipshutz also compared Martinez to Del Rey and Lorde, saying, “Martinez is clearly cribbing from the dimly lit pop stylings of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, but while her wispy delivery strikes the same femme fatale poses, she lacks the subtlety of her influences”, and that “Martinez is admirably ambitious, but her insistence on sticking to Cry Baby’ s central idea leaves her contorting into uncomfortable positions”.
