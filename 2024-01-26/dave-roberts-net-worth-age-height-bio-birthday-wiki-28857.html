Former outfielder known for his raw speed and base-stealing skills, he was a member of the 2004 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox. In 2016, he became manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was named 2016 NL Manager of the Year and he helped the Dodgers reach the 2017 World Series.</p><p>Gutsy starting pitcher <a href=#>Curt Schilling</a> was his teammate on the 2004 World Series champion Red Sox.</p><p>Roberts decided to attend UCLA and joined the Bruins baseball team as a walk-on outfielder after impressing coaches with his speed and enthusiasm. He hit .331 as a sophomore with 36 stolen bases and as a junior he hit .296 with 28 steals. The Cleveland Indians drafted him in the 47th round of the 1993 MLB draft. He was disappointed with being drafted so low, behind seven other UCLA juniors and his coach told him he needed to improve his defense and that his weak throwing arm was hurting his draft stock. He improved by getting to the ball quicker and was able to lead the Bruins in outfield assists as a senior, while also hitting .353 with 45 steals. He left UCLA as the school’s all-time stolen-base leader and graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1995.</p><p>Roberts was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 28th round of the 1994 MLB draft and signed with them on June 9, 1994. He began his career with the Jamestown Jammers, the Tigers short-season class “A” team in the New York–Pennsylvania League. Roberts hit .292 with 12 steals for the Jammers, who won the division title with a 42–32 record. For the 1995 season, he was promoted to play for the Lakeland Tigers in the Florida State League, where he hit .303 in 92 games with 30 stolen bases, fourth best in the league.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Okinawa, Japan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dave Roberts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dave</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roberts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Manager</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Okinawa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Eiko Roberts, Waymon Roberts</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tricia Roberts</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cole Roberts, Emmerson Roberts</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dave Roberts ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Roberts later said that his promotion to Buffalo was exciting to him because he realized he was getting close to the big leagues and his time there allowed him to become a better ballplayer.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Dave Roberts height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Dave <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1996, Roberts was assigned to the Visalia Oaks of the California League. The Oaks were a co-op team made up of players from several organizations. He was frustrated with the assignment and thought about quitting baseball but his father talked him out of it. In 126 games, he hit .272 with 65 stolen bases, which led all of minor league baseball and he scored 112 runs, tops in the Cal League. He appeared in three games for the AA Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League at the end of the season and had two hits in nine at-bats.

In 19 games for the Indians, he had only two hits in 10 at-bats while being used primarily as a late-game defensive replacement. After the season, he had surgery on his left shoulder to repair a torn labrum and fraying around his rotator cuff, which caused him to begin the following season on the 60-day disabled list. When he returned on June 24, he was optioned back to the Bisons, where he hit .303 in 62 games. His 97 career steals in parts of four seasons in Buffalo ranks as the tops in franchise history and he would eventually be selected to the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame. He was again recalled to the majors in September and had four hits in 12 at-bats in 15 games for the Indians. In parts of three seasons with Cleveland, he hit .242 in 75 games.</p><h2>Who is Dave Roberts Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Dave Roberts</strong> married to <strong>Tricia Roberts </strong>.
