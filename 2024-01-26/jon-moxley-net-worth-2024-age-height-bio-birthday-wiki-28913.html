[…] So, right before I’m about to go out the ring announcer said, ‘What’s the name?’ I didn’t have one. […] This other wrestler guy was just like, ‘It’s like the Varsity Blues guy. He’s like the guy from Varsity Blues, Jonathan Moxley.’ They’re like, ‘That’s cool.’ I was too nervous to say yes or no. […] Actually, in the movie, it’s Moxon. So the guy screwed up the name a little bit. It wasn’t my idea at all.

The trio declared themselves The Shield, vowed to rally against “injustice” and denied working for Punk, but they routinely emerged from the crowd to attack Punk’s adversaries, including Ryback and the WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane), establishing themselves as villains. This led to a six-man Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match being set up for the TLC pay-per-view event on December 16, where Ambrose, Rollins, and Reigns defeated Ryback and Team Hell No in their debut match. The Shield continued to aid Punk after TLC, both on Raw and at the Royal Rumble in January 2013. The night after the Royal Rumble, it was revealed through footage that Punk and his manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield to work for them all along. The Shield then quietly ended their association with Punk.</p><h3>Why did Dean Ambrose left?</h3><p>Reports surfaced early this year that Dean Ambrose (real name Jonathan David Good) was tapping out of the ring for good.
