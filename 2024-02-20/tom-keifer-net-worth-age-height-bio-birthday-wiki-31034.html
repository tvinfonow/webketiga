He had started writing original material. He also found financial support by walking race horses at tracks and delivering film to developing outlets. Keifer came closer to his dream of being a successful artist by forming the hard rock band, Cinderella with good friend and bassist Eric Brittingham, whom he met on Halloween night in 1980 in a bar bathroom, and also who had been in Saints in Hell. Despite being shy, Keifer took on the role of lead singer because they could not find anyone they liked to sing for the band. In articles, Keifer has said, “I don’t feel comfortable when I’m up there singing and not playing guitar. I feel naked when it’s just me and the microphone.”</p><p>It was then Jon Bon Jovi in 1985, at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that convinced his Mercury A&R manager Derek Schulman to sign the band. Bon Jovi has been quoted as saying “I saw Tommy Keifer onstage delivering some pretty nifty, growling vocals. Then he whipped out this Les Paul and proceeded to lay into some astounding sounds. This guy struck me as a star right then and there.” Keifer and company experienced much success with their albums, Night Songs, Long Cold Winter, and Heartbreak Station. Keifer enjoyed the reputation of being a prolific songwriter with hits such as “Shake Me”, ‘”Nobody’s Fool”, “Gypsy Road”, “Don’t Know What You Got”, “Coming Home”, “Shelter Me”, and “Heartbreak Station”. He also enjoyed spending time with his wife, Emily, whom he had married in 1987 after years of dating.

Tom Keifer celebrates birthday on January 26 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 2013, Keifer discussed the progress of his solo album, and was quoted saying the following: “The idea for a solo record started in the Nineties when the band parted ways and we left Universal,” said the frontman. “There was just a changing of the guard in the industry at that time and I started thinking about a solo record. I wrote for it for many years and the songs just kept going on the pile and I never got around to actually making a record… We started cutting tracks for this record in 2003 and I went to the pile of songs that had been building up and picked some that I liked and I’ve just been working on it ever since. It was produced independently of a label, because the idea from the beginning was to just work and record until I was happy with it. I wrote with a lot of different people – my wife, Savannah, who’s a great writer, co-wrote a lot of the songs on the record and also co-produced the record with me, and a good friend of ours, Chuck Turner, who’s a great engineer and producer. So from the beginning, the attitude was, ‘Let’s have fun and just make a great record and it’ll be done when it’s done.’ Little did we know it’d be nine years later… it’s done and we went through some crazy stuff and mixed and remixed and reworked things over and over and probably made a lot of mistakes along the way, but finally got it where we were all happy with it, so here it is.”</p><h3>What happened to lead singer of Cinderella?</h3><p>After the Heartbreak Station tour <b>Keifer lost his voice and was diagnosed with paralysis of the left vocal cord</b>.
