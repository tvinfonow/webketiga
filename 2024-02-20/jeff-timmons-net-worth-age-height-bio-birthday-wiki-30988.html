He was initially skeptical about taking up the offer, but was encouraged by his wife Amanda, and his decision launched a new phase in his career. The success of mixing his performance with the male revue inspired Timmons to propose a more mainstream version with the men performing more than a strip show, but this idea was not supported by Chippendales management. Together with Emmy-nominated choreographer Glenn Douglas Packard and entrepreneur “Money Mike” Foland, Timmons created the “Men of the Strip” revue, a process documented in a 2014 docusoap film of the same name, produced for the E! network. Timmons describes the film as “like Magic Mike with elements of Sex and the City: the guys’ personal lives, they’re fighting to be the best at what they can do, but at the end of the day, they’re family.” He also said that the film covers the audition process, “how they navigate being on stage” and that while “[p]eople are going to think they know what male strippers are all about, each of these guys are unique and interesting.” The Men of the Strip troupe earned a contract and regular performances at the Tropicana Las Vegas from 2017, as well as touring in the United States and Canada. The Men of the Strip performers are required to sing and dance in shows, at times performing with Timmons who also sometimes acts as MC.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jeff Timmons height</b> <strong>5 feet 8 inches</strong> Jeff <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 8 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Timmons and the other members of 98 Degrees decided to take a break in 2002 after their world tour.
