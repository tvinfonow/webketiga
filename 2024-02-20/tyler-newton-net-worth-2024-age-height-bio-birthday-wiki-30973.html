Tyler Isaac Newton (born May 13, 1982) is an American professional basketball player who plays for the Rera Kamuy Hokkaido of the Japan Basketball League (JBL Super League). Newton, commonly nicknamed “T-Newt,” is 6&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in (2.08&nbsp;m) tall and plays the power forward position, but is also capable of playing other frontcourt positions like center or small forward.</p><p>Newton is a versatile, all-purpose front court player who mostly plays the power forward position, but has also played center, small forward, and point forward throughout his career. Newton is considered one of the best shooters in Japan, hitting over 60 percent of his field goal attempts. Newton briefly struggled with his free throw shooting early in the 2008–09 JBL season. However, by converting 80 percent (12/15) of his free throw attempts against a “Hack-a-Newt” defense by the Mitsubishi Diamond Dolphins, Newton has proven to be a solid free throw shooter as well.</p><p>After a season with the Antelope Valley (California) Marauders, Newton transferred to Shasta College in Redding, California, where he led the Knights to a 28–6 record while being named to the All-Conference team and honored as an All-State player.</p><p>Newton attended John Burroughs High School in Burbank, California, where he lettered in volleyball and water polo while earning a scholastic achievement award. Newton began playing organized basketball during his sophomore year in high school, but failed to make the varsity squad and was never used in a game. By his senior year, Newton was scoring career bests of 33 points and 24 rebounds. The big stats were no fluke, as he grabbed 24 rebounds twice during the season and was the fourth leading rebounder in the entire Los Angeles area that year, leading his team to a 17–6 record en route to a league title, and Honorable Mention All-Foothill Conference honors. Newton was inducted into the John Burroughs Middle School Hall of Fame in 2006.</p><p align=justify>In 2007, Newton was selected as one of two foreign (non-Japanese) players to lead a new Japanese franchise in the city of Sapporo. Newton joined Japanese superstar Takehiko Orimo for the inaugural season of the Rera Kamuy Hokkaido and, after a season of adjustment, they have turned the team into a leading force in the JBL. Newton and his team have the enthusiastic support of local residents, who are excited to have professional basketball in their city. Newton leads his team in scoring (17 points per game), rebounding (12 per game), blocked shots (1.4 per game) and being 4 feet taller than everyone else.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tyler Newton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tyler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tyler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1982</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Utica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Utica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tyler Newton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
