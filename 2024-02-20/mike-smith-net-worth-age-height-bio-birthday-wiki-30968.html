Mike Smith (born on October 11, 1973) is a musician, best known as the former guitarist of Snot, TheStart, and Limp Bizkit. Currently he is the singer and guitarist for the band Shedding Light (previously known as Evolver). Mike Smith also appeared in Staind’s music video “Outside”.</p><p>In late 2001, Limp Bizkit was left without a guitar player due to the departure of Wes Borland. The entire ordeal of choosing a new guitarist was taken very slowly, with various options taken into consideration. Initially, a nationwide audition, entitled “Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is,” was carried out to find a guitarist for the band, but nobody was chosen out of the thousands of participants. Smith had known members of the band previously, as they were friends with Snot. They decided to give him a shot at the position, and in 2002, he was chosen as the band’s guitarist. Fred wanted Mike to create a full album of songs with the band in between their performance at WrestleMania XIX and The Summer Sanitarium Tour. Together they wrote and recorded at least 14 songs of which 7 of them made it onto their fourth studio album, Results May Vary.</p><p>Mike is lead singer, guitarist and songwriter for the alternative metal band Evolver, featuring Anthony Grabowski on drums, Keith Thompson on bass/backing vocals and John Cummings, who was replaced by Drew Yount on lead guitar. Their self-titled debut album, which was mixed by Brian Virtue and mastered by Brian Johnson, was released on November 8, 2011 after being pushed back numerous time through iTunes. They recently signed with Union Entertainment Group, Inc.</p><p align=justify>Smith went on to form a band called Hero with former Snot drummer Jamie Miller, as well as Aimee Echo & Scott Ellis of Human Waste Project. In July 1999, Hero were signed to 143 Records/Atlantic Records and recorded their debut album named “Circles.” The band was forced to change their name due to legal issues. At the suggestion of Aimee’s mother, they changed it to TheStart. In late 2000, Mike Smith left the band. After various issues, the album was eventually released in July 2001 under The Label/Geffen Records and renamed Shakedown!, with the bulk of Smith’s parts recut by Miller.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Musician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Middle River</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Middle River</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brigitte Acton (m. 2010)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Smith ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
