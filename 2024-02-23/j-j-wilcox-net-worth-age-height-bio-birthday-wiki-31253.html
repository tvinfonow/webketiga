J.” Wilcox, Jr. (born February 14, 1991) is an American football safety who is currently a free agent. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He played college football at Georgia Southern University. He has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets and Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>On December 4, 2012, it was reported that Wilcox had accepted his invitation to play in the 2013 Senior Bowl. He became the second player from Georgia Southern to appear in the Senior Bowl, the first being Adrian Peterson in 2002. Under Detroit Lions’ head coach Jim Schwartz, he had impressive performances in practice during the week leading up to the Senior Bowl. On January 26, 2013, Wilcox recorded two combined tackles to help the South defeat the North 21–16.</p><p>He was named the backup free safety to Mike Mitchell to begin the regular season. Wilcox made his Pittsburgh Steelers’ debut in their season-opening 21–18 victory over the Cleveland Browns and finished with two combined tackles. He delivered a helmet-to-helmet hit on Browns’ wide receiver Corey Coleman in the fourth quarter and was knocked unconscious in the process. The Pittsburgh Steelers received a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty and Wilcox was fined $24,309 by the NFL days later. He missed the following week after being diagnosed with a concussion. On September 24, he collected five combined tackles and intercepted Mike Glennon for his first pick with the Steelers, as they lost 17–23 to the Chicago Bears. The following week, he made his first start as a member of the Steelers and finished with three solo tackles during a 26–9 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. He appeared in 12 games (one start), making 12 tackles, one interception and one pass defensed.</p><p>Wilcox started the Dallas Cowboys’ season-opener against The New York Giants and recorded three combined tackles and defended a pass in their 27–26 victory.

Unfortunately, Wilcox suffered a broken nose on the play, but continued to play the remainder of the game while Beckham briefly left the game. The following week, the Cowboys matched up at the Philadelphia Eagles and made a solo tackle and intercepted a pass attempt by Sam Bradford, as the Cowboys defeated them 20-10</p><p align=justify>Due to the proven performance escalated that was placed in the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, Wilcox base salary for 2016 was raised from $690,000 to $1.68 million. This was due to him playing in 45.2% of the defensive snaps in his first three seasons, above the required 35%.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>J.
