American actress who became known to audiences as Haley on the long-running series One Tree Hill and as Michelle Santos on the soap opera Guiding Light.</p><p>She starred in One Tree Hill with <a href=#>Chad Michael Murray</a>.</p><p>At the age of seventeen, Lenz played the teenage clone of Reva Shayne on the CBS Daytime soap opera Guiding Light for nine episodes. Her stint earned her such favorable reviews from viewers, critics, and Guiding Light executives alike that Lenz was eventually recast as Michelle Bauer Santos upon Rebecca Budig’s exit. This unusual move was described as “unheard of” in the industry according to CBS producer Mickey Dwyer-Dobbin. In 1999, while working on Guiding Light, she graduated from Eastern Christian High School in New Jersey. She also landed the role of Rose Cronin in Mary and Rhoda, a made-for-television movie that reunited Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern. At the time Lenz juggled a heavy storyline, a television movie portraying Mary Tyler Moore’s daughter, a one-year run of a New York cabaret called Foxy Ladies Love/Boogie 70’s Explosion, and the lead role in an independent film. Lenz also filmed two pilots: one playing the daughter of Paul Sorvino, and the other as the lead in the WB’s 1972.</p><p>Since Lenz’s exit from Guiding Light she has completed a demo of original music. Trained by the director of the Brooklyn College of Opera, Lenz plays the guitar and piano, and writes her own music. Her first album, entitled Preincarnate, was released in October 2002. She worked under the direction of director Garry Marshall and alongside musician Carole King on a new musical adapted from the series Happy Days. She also took the opportunity to work in a public reading of a musical version of the novel The Outsiders directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman.</p><p align=justify>She has a child with Michael Galeotti, whom she was married to from 2005 to 2012. She then dated <a href=#>Wes Ramsey</a> but the couple split in 2015.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bethany Joy Lenz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bethany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lenz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hollywood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cathie Lenz, Robert Lenz</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Galeotti</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Maria Rose Galeotti</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bethany Joy Lenz ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
