Southpaw has had an extremely professional career that was extremely successful, winning gold medals at Olympic Games in 2008 as well as 2012 Olympics in featherweight and light and lightweight, respectively.</p><p>His first professional fight was a knockout triumph against Jose Ramirez on a card featuring&nbsp;His first pro fight was a knockout victory over Jose Ramirez on a card headlined by <a href=#>Juan Manuel Marquez</a> vs. Timothy Bradley.&nbsp;fighting. Timothy Bradley.</p><p>After failing to make the fight happen earlier in the year, Top Rank vice president Carl Moretti confirmed on September 28 that Lomachenko would defend his WBO title against 30 year old unbeaten Jamaican boxer Nicholas Walters (26-0-1, 21 KOs) at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas on 26 November on HBO. In previous negotiations, Walters turned down a career-high $550,000 purse, even after Lomachenko offered him a further $300,000 from his own purse if Walters won. HBO provided the remainder of Walter’s purse for the fight to go ahead. The event marked Bob Arum’s 2,000th promoted card, as well as celebrating his 50th anniversary as a promoter.</p><p>Following a third successful defense, Lomachenko, still the reigning WBO featherweight champion decided to move up weight to super featherweight to challenge Román ‘Rocky’ Martínez (29-2-3, 17 KOs) for his WBO super featherweight title on 11 June 2016 at the Madison Square Garden Theater. Martinez was coming off a draw against Orlando Salido in September 2015, after he controversially defeated him in their first fight in April 2015 for the WBO title. Lomachenko became the fastest boxer to win a world title in two weight divisions knocking out Martinez in the 5th round of the world title fight. Lomachenko dominated the fight from the start with superior footwork, hand speed and slick punching from different angles. According to CompuBox, Lomachenko out-landed Martinez 87 to 34. After the fight, Lomachenko called out Orlando Salido, “Hey Salido, I’m ready to fight you at any time, before the Vargas fight, I told him to win the fight but I never told him I wasn’t going to fight him if he didn’t, so let’s do it. I want to revenge Salido for my fans and give them a win over him.” Lomachenko was paid $850,000 for the bout, at the time a career-high purse.</p><p align=justify>He was taught under the tutelage of his dad Anatoly Lomachenko.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vasyl Lomachenko</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vasyl</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lomachenko</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1988</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ukraine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Elena Lomachenko</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Viktoriia Lomachenko, Anatoly Lomachenko</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Vasyl Lomachenko ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

A possible unification with WBO titleholder Raymundo Beltran (35-7-1, 21 KOs) was a likely possibility. After vacating his WBO title, Arum stated Lomachenko would not fight on 25 August. It was later revealed that earlier in the bout against Linares, Lomachenko suffered a torn labrum in his right shoulder. He underwent surgery on 30 May at the Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles. According to Lomachenko, the shoulder popped out and then back in in the second round. A new return date of December 2018 was targeted. On 10 July, Lomachenko revealed he would return on 25 August. However, on 31 July, his manager Egis Klimas told The Boxing Beat on ESPN+, Lomachenko would make his ring return on 1 December. In the interview, he also stated it would likely be a unification fight against the winner of the Raymundo Beltran vs. José Pedraza bout, which was scheduled to be contested on 25 August. Pedraza (25-2, 12 KOs) defeated Beltran via unanimous decision, winning the WBO title and setting up a fight with Lomachenko. In September, The Ring magazine announced the unification fight between Lomachenko and Pedraza would take place on 8 December 2018 at the Hulu Theatre in New York City.</p><h2>Vasyl Lomachenko Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Vasyl Lomachenko is one of the <strong>richest Boxer</strong> from Ukraine.

Rodriguez earned the title shot after knocking out Martin Cardona. The fight was announced to take place on 2 May 2015 on the under-card of Mayweather-Pacquiao at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Prior to the fight, Rodriguez was on a 17-fight winning streak dating back to 2010, where the fight resulted in a first round technical draw. Top Rank announced before the fight that Lomachenko had signed a five-year contract extension. On fight night, Lomachenko retained his WBO title against Rodriguez via a ninth-round KO victory. Lomachenko’s speed and precision was too much for Rodriguez, who took a knee twice in the fight, once in the seventh and again in the ninth, which ended the bout. He was also docked a point by referee in fifth round for a low blow. Lomachenko landed 227 of 586 punches thrown (39%) compared to Rodriguez who landed only 55 of 285 (19%). After the fight, Lomachenko spoke through a translator about his performance, “I was just boxing for the fans, having a good time out there.” Top Rank were hoping to match Lomachenko with then-WBA featherweight champion Nicholas Walters in a unification fight. Lomachenko had a $750,000 purse for the defence.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Vasyl Anatoliyovych Lomachenko (Ukrainian: Василь Анатолійович Ломаченко , IPA:&nbsp;[wɐˈsɪlʲ lomɐˈtʃɛnko] ; also spelled Vasiliy; born 17 February 1988) is a Ukrainian professional boxer.
