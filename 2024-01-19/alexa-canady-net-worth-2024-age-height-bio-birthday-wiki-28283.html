American neurosurgeon who broke a barrier in 1981 by becoming the first African-American woman to specialize in neurosurgery.</p><p>She is an important female doctor just as <a href=#>Elizabeth Blackwell</a> was.</p><p>She faced many obstacles throughout her school years. However, despite these obstacles, Canady stood out among her peers academically, both in the classroom and by earning high scores on her tests in school. Before university, Alexa Canady was nominated as a National Achievement Scholar in 1967. Canady attended the University of Michigan where she received her B.S. degree in zoology in 1971 and became a member of Delta Sigma Theta. Her time at the University of Michigan was not without its struggles; almost dropped out of college at one point due to a “crisis of confidence”, but learned of a minority scholarship for medicine and decided to pursue it. She would then go on to receive her M.D. with cum laude honors from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1975. In medical school, Canady felt as if she, and the other female students, were often overlooked by the professors. This only encouraged her to work harder. Although she initially had an interest in internal medicine, Dr. Canady decided on neurosurgery after falling in love with neurology during her first two years of medical school. She settled on this specialty against the recommendations of her advisors. Knowing that gaining a residency as a black student would be difficult, Canady began building her résumé, reading many articles and attending every conference and seminar she could, sometimes asking questions just to get known in the small field. Her appreciation for the fluidity of human anatomy would serve her well in her competitive field.</p><p>She then became a surgical intern at the Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1975–1976, rotating under Dr. William F. Collins. Although an exceptional student, she still faced prejudice and discriminatory comments as she was both the first black and female intern in the program. On her first day as an intern, she was told that “you must be our new equal-opportunity package”. Despite these prejudices, she was voted one of the top residents by her fellow physicians.</p><p align=justify>She is the daughter of Elizabeth Hortense and Dr. Clinton Canady, Jr., a former national sorority president and dentist, respectively.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alexa Canady</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alexa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canady</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lansing</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Clinton Canady, Jr</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>George Davis</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alexa Canady ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
