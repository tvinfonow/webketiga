Thomas said: “Having run my own business before being elected an MP, I am acutely aware of the need to keep a close eye on what is being spent. I constantly look at ways of reducing my expenses but believe my claims are very reasonable for an MP representing a constituency in the extreme south west of the country”.</p><p align=justify>In January of 2016 in January of 2016, The Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to Parliament which would have required private landlords improve their properties “fit for human habitation”.&nbsp;According to the list of interest, Thomas was one of 72 Conservative MPs who opposed the amendment , who had personally earned income from renting out properties.&nbsp;Thomas was one of the 72 Conservative MPs who voted against it. Conservative Government had responded to the amendment saying that they believed that homes are meant to be suitable to be used by humans, but they were unable to approve the new law that would expressly oblige it.&nbsp;Thomas was a supporter of the Leave campaign during 2016.
