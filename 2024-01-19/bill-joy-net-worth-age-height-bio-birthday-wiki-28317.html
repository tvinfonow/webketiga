Famous for his role as cofounder of Sun Microsystems computer, software and IT business In addition, he is known for his work as the creator for the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix operating system, as well as Vi, Unix’s text editing software.</p><p>In the the 1980s Joy founded Sun Microsystems together with&nbsp;In the early 1980s, Joy established Sun Microsystems along with <a href=#>Vinod Khosla</a>, Andreas von Bechtolsheim, and Scott McNealy., Andreas von Bechtolsheim and Scott McNealy.</p><p>Joy was born in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, Michigan, to William Joy, a school vice-principal and counselor, and Ruth Joy. He earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan and a Master of Science in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1979.</p><p>According to a Salon article, during the early 1980s, DARPA had contracted the company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to add TCP/IP to Berkeley UNIX. Joy had been instructed to plug BBN’s stack into Berkeley Unix, but he refused to do so, as he had a low opinion of BBN’s TCP/IP. So, Joy wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Bill Joy</b>'s net worth <strong>$1.5 Billion</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>After earning his bachelor’s diploma in electrical engineering at the University of Michigan, he earned graduate degrees in computing and engineering at Berkeley, the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p align=justify>In his enthralling Wired Magazine essay “Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us,” Joy claims that the same technologies Joy and his coworkers worked hard to create are putting the future of humanity in danger.</p><p align=justify>William Nelson Joy (born November 8, 1954) is an American computer engineer and venture capitalist. He co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 along with Scott McNealy, Vinod Khosla, and Andy Bechtolsheim, and served as chief scientist at the company until 2003. He played an integral role in the early development of BSD UNIX while a graduate student at Berkeley, and he is the original author of the vi text editor. He also wrote the 2000 essay Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us, in which he expressed deep concerns over the development of modern technologies.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1.5 Billion</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Computer Scientist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1999, Joy co-founded a venture capital firm, HighBAR Ventures, with two Sun colleagues, Andy Bechtolsheim and Roy Thiele-Sardiña. In January 2005 he was named a partner in venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. There, Joy has made several investments in green energy industries, even though he does not have any credentials in the field. He once said, “My method is to look at something that seems like a good idea and assume it’s true”.</p><p>In 2000, Joy gained notoriety with the publication of his article in Wired Magazine, Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us, in which he declared, in what some have described as a “neo-Luddite” position, that he was convinced that growing advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology would bring risks to humanity. He argued that intelligent robots would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He supports and promotes the idea of abandonment of GNR (genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics) technologies, instead of going into an arms race between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against Grey goo “bad” nano-machines). This stance of broad relinquishment was criticized by technologists such as technological-singularity thinker Ray Kurzweil, who instead advocates fine-grained relinquishment and ethical guidelines. Joy was also criticized by The American Spectator, which characterized Joy’s essay as a (possibly unwitting) rationale for statism.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bill Joy height</b> Not available right now.
