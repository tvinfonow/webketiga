He was not a starter during his first two seasons with the Providence Friars men’s basketball team and averaged two points per game as a freshman and three as a sophomore under coach Joe Mullaney. Mullaney retired after the 1984–85 season, and New York Knicks assistant coach Rick Pitino became Providence’s new head coach. Soon after, Donovan informed Pitino that he would like to transfer to Fairfield or Northeastern to get more playing time. However, when Pitino called the coaches of those smaller conference schools on Donovan’s behalf, they declined to offer him a scholarship, so Pitino advised Donovan to stay at Providence and get himself into better physical shape for the upcoming season.</p><p>Donovan was drafted by the Utah Jazz in the third round (68th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft, but was waived before the regular season began. He signed with the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association, hoping for another chance to play in the NBA.

He left the CBA in January 1989 and took a job with a Wall Street investment banking firm. Donovan was “miserable” during his brief stint as a stock broker, and he especially hated the required cold-call stock sales. After just a few weeks at the firm, he called Rick Pitino to seek advice about becoming a basketball coach. Donovan had not been a vocal leader as a player, and Pitino doubted if he had the necessary communication skills required for coaching, so he suggested that Donovan give the financial sector more of a chance before rushing to change careers.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Billy Donovan height</b> Not available right now.
