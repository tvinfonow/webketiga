He played the role of Toplin, a “geeky” kid at a birthday party with a crush on Drake and Josh’s younger sister Megan Parker (played by Miranda Cosgrove) in the episode Battle of Panthatar. Kress did not know it at the time, but this small role would lead to an opportunity that would catapult him to stardom. While filming his scenes for Drake & Josh, television show creator and executive producer Dan Schneider took an interest in him and called him over to talk with him and to introduce him to some network executives. At the time, Schneider was developing a new series for Nickelodeon, and was on the lookout for someone to play one of the lead roles in the untitled project, which would later become known as iCarly.</p><h2>Nathan Kress Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Nathan Kress is one of the <strong>richest TV Actor</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Nathan Kress</b>'s net worth <strong>$1.5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At the age of three, he began modeling professionally and acting.

He has two brothers, Andrew and Kevin, neither of whom are involved in show business. Kress began his professional career at the age of four when he displayed a natural talent for memorizing and re-enacting the shows he saw on television, prompting his mother to take him to an open “cattle call” showcase where he was quickly signed with a talent agent. Over the next three years, Kress modeled for various print advertisements, as well as performing in numerous commercials and voice-over roles; the most notable of which was his dual role as the voices of “Easy” and “Tough Pup” in the 1998 feature film Babe: Pig in the City. At the age of six, he decided to take a break from acting and return to regular school, where he led a relatively “normal” life for the next five years until deciding to return to acting professionally at the age of eleven.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On September 8, 2007, iCarly debuted on Nickelodeon and quickly became a fan favorite. On the show, Kress plays Fredward “Freddie” Benson, the technical producer for the fictional web-show iCarly, which stars his character’s two best friends, Carly Shay (Cosgrove) and Samantha “Sam” Puckett (McCurdy). His character has a crush on the main character Carly, and a feuding, bitter-sweet, love/hate relationship with Carly’s best friend and web-show co-star, Sam. The show became Nickelodeon’s most-watched show aimed at tweens, and catapulted Kress to international fame among adolescents. Kress’ performance on the show has been characterized by one reviewer for Variety as “sweetly nerdy”.</p><p>The role of Toplin was similar to a character named Freddie that Schneider was looking to cast on iCarly. Schneider had been so impressed with Kress’ performance that he remembered him, and about 6 months after filming his small role on Drake & Josh, Kress was called in to audition for the role of “Freddie” shortly after his fourteenth birthday. After several rounds of auditions, Kress was invited back for a screen test with Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette McCurdy and a couple of days later he was notified that he had landed the role of “Freddie”. Although iCarly would not premiere until the fall of 2007, the decision was made to cut Kress’ scenes with Miranda Cosgrove out of the Drake & Josh episode that had started it all, in order to avoid any potential confusion among the young Nickelodeon viewing audience.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Nathan Kress height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Nathan <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In April 2005, Kress made his first live television appearance since returning to acting in a comedy sketch on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he played a young Simon Cowell of American Idol, and would continue to appear in various comedy sketches on the show a total of 5 times over the next year. Kress continued to land steady work over the next two years, appearing in guest-starring roles on dramatic series such as House, Standoff, and Without a Trace as well as the Disney Channel comedy series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Kress also appeared in several short films including Pickled, Magnus, Inc., and Bag, for which he was awarded a 168 Film Festival Jury Award for his portrayal of a small-fry drug dealer with a conscience. In addition to live-action roles, Kress continued to work as a voice-actor, lending his voice to various characters in the animated feature film Chicken Little and on the Nickelodeon animated series Shuriken School.</p><p align=justify>In March 2010, Kress guest-starred in the CBS television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in season 10: episode 15 titled “Neverland”. Kress played Mason Ward, one of two best friends of a fourteen-year-old victim with traces of blood of an inmate under his fingernails. Kress told Fanlala.com of his CSI role “It was a great opportunity to try my hand at something different. I had done scenes in dramas in the past, but other than a few semi-serious scenes on iCarly, it had been a long time since I’ve had the opportunity to do anything other than comedy.” Later that same year, Kress returned to comedic roles, guest-starring as Prince Gabriel on the Nickelodeon comedy series True Jackson, VP, and as the voice of Ronald on the Nickelodeon animated series The Penguins of Madagascar.</p><h2>Who is Nathan Kress Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Nathan Kress</strong> married to <strong>London Elise Kress </strong>.
