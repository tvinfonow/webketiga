Hall of Fame NHL defenseman and 13-time All-Star who spent his career with the Calgary Flames and St. Louis Blues.</p><p>He was teammates with <a href=#>Theo Fleury</a> on the Calgary Flames.</p><p>MacInnis left home in 1979 to join the Regina Pat Blues of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). He appeared in 59&nbsp;games, scoring 20&nbsp;goals and 48&nbsp;points with the Pat Blues, and appeared in two Western Hockey League (WHL) games with the Regina Pats. He then moved to Ontario and joined the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Following a season in which he scored 39&nbsp;points in 47&nbsp;games and winning the League Championship with Kitchener in the 1980–81 OHL season, MacInnis was rated as the second best defensive prospect at the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Calgary Flames in the first round, 15th overall. The Flames invited him to their training camp, although they did not expect him to play for them immediately, and he was returned to junior.</p><p>MacInnis was best known for the power and strength of his slapshot. The Flames selected him in the 1981 Draft on the strength of his shot alone; his skating ability was so poor when he arrived for his first training camp in Calgary he earned the nickname “Chopper”. While some reporters expected he would be a bust as a result, MacInnis said the patience the Flames showed him in his early days as a professional allowed him to develop into a more complete defenceman.</p><p align=justify>His father, Alex MacInnis, worked as a miner.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al MacInnis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MacInnis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anna Mae MacInnis, Alex MacInnis</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jackie Maclnnis</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ryan MacInnis, Lauren Maclnnis, Riley Maclnnis, Carson Maclnnis, Ryan Maclnnis</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Al MacInnis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

A first round selection of the Flames in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, he went on to become a 12-time All-Star. He was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs in 1989 after leading the Flames to the Stanley Cup championship. He was voted the winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy in 1999 as the top defenceman in the league while a member of the Blues.

In his first full season with the Flames, MacInnis took a slapshot from just outside the Blues’ defensive zone that struck goaltender Mike Liut on the mask. The shot split Liut’s helmet while the puck fell into the net for a goal. The power of his shot, and the fear it inspired in his opposition, led to MacInnis’ success as an offensive-defenceman, especially as a threat on the power play. He won the “Hardest Shot” competition at All-Star Game skills competitions seven times between 1991 and 2003. He occasionally topped 100 miles per hour (160&nbsp;km/h), including his win in the 2000 All-Star Game.</p><p>A point-per-game pace in 1984–85 (66&nbsp;points in 67&nbsp;games) earned MacInnis his first All-Star Game appearance, playing in front of his hometown fans at the 1985 game in Calgary. He was voted a Second-Team All-Star for the 1986–87 NHL season, and started his first All-Star Game in 1988. He was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as top defenceman in the league in three consecutive seasons, 1989, 1990 and 1991, but failed to win the award each time.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Al MacInnis height</b> <strong>6 feet 1 inches</strong> Al <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 1 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>MacInnis made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 30, 1981, against the Boston Bruins.
