The owners of the track, Luigi and Massimo Buratti, were impressed by him and after proving himself in a 100&nbsp;cc machine, he moved up to the 135&nbsp;cc version before, on the same day, being allowed onto the Grand Prix circuit with a Formula Four car.</p><p align=justify>In 1992, he raced in the Japanese Formula Three series with the TOM’s team, winning three races and placing second in the championship, as well as third in the non-championship Macau Grand Prix.
