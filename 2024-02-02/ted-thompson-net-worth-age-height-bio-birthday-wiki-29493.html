In a 1980 game against the New York Jets, Thompson successfully converted four extra-point attempts as the emergency kicker.</p><p>In 1992, Thompson was hired by Ron Wolf as a scout for the Green Bay Packers.

When Thompson was hired the Packers were over the salary cap for the upcoming 2005 season. Some of Thompson’s first decisions included declining to re-sign starting guard Marco Rivera and releasing starting guard Mike Wahle and starting safety Darren Sharper, three key components of the team’s three-time NFC North division championship team. Thompson’s first draft netted a quarterback in first round pick Aaron Rodgers, as well as defensive starters in safety Nick Collins and linebacker Brady Poppinga. The drafting of Rodgers was especially notable in that he had been expected to be selected much earlier in the draft but wound up falling to the late first round. In free agency following the draft, Thompson signed low-priced players, picking up guards Matt O’Dwyer and Adrian Klemm to make up for the losses of Wahle and Rivera. However, O’Dwyer was cut during training camp, and Klemm was benched towards the end of the season. Thompson acquired several free agents during the season that proved more successful, including running back Samkon Gado, tight end Donald Lee and wide receiver Rod Gardner. Still, the team struggled to overcome injuries at numerous offensive skill positions, most notably season-ending injuries to #1 running back Ahman Green, #2 RB Najeh Davenport and #1 wide receiver Javon Walker, and Green Bay finished the season with a 4–12 record, the worst record for the franchise since 1991.</p><h2>Ted Thompson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ted Thompson is one of the <strong>richest Sports Executive</strong> from United States.

He was the general manager of the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) from 2005 to 2017. He was named to the post on January 14, 2005, by former Packers president and CEO Bob Harlan. Thompson took over the general manager duties from Mike Sherman, who had been serving as both head coach and general manager. Prior to becoming the Packers’ general manager, Thompson served with the Seattle Seahawks as their vice president of operations from 2000 to 2004. Thompson had previously worked for the Packers organization from 1992 to 1999, serving as their assistant director of pro personnel in 1992, their director of pro personnel from 1993 to 1997, and their director of player personnel from 1997 to 1999. Thompson also had a 10-year playing career in the NFL as a linebacker and special teams player with the Houston Oilers from 1975 to 1984. In May 2019, Thompson revealed that he had been suffering from an autonomic disorder, and that that was why he would no longer be leading the Packers’ football operations.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sports Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During Thompson’s tenure in Seattle, the Seahawks advanced to the playoffs twice. In 2005, following Thompson’s departure to the Packers, the Seahawks had one of their best success in team history, reaching the Super Bowl. Many of the players on Seattle’s Super Bowl team were acquired under Thompson’s direction, including HB Shaun Alexander, WR Darrell Jackson, OG Steve Hutchinson, CB Marcus Trufant, and K Josh Brown,</p><p>In the 2006 NFL Draft, Thompson amassed 12 picks and continued his restructuring on the defensive side of the football. With the fifth overall pick in the draft, Thompson selected linebacker A. J. Hawk from Ohio State. Thompson later added another Big Ten linebacker, Abdul Hodge from Iowa. Thompson also nabbed eventual starter Johnny Jolly with a 6th round pick. Thompson also addressed offensive deficiencies during the draft by nabbing wide receiver Greg Jennings, guard Jason Spitz and guard Daryn Colledge. Several of these draft picks contributed almost immediately to the Packers’ lineup. Jennings, Colledge, Spitz, and Hawk started the entire year and a 5th round pick, Tony Moll, started 10 games in his rookie season while other offensive linemen were out with injuries. Jennings, Hawk, and Colledge were also selected to NFL’s official all-rookie team.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ted Thompson height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Ted <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Packers entered the offseason with a league best $32 million available under the salary cap. However, Thompson elected not to retain several veterans including kicker Ryan Longwell, center Mike Flanagan, or linebacker Na’il Diggs. Thompson retained several other veterans, as the team re-signed Pro Bowl defensive end Aaron Kampman, running back Ahman Green, guard Kevin Barry and fullback William Henderson to new contracts. Thompson also was more active in free agency than he was in 2005, focusing mostly on defense by signing cornerback Charles Woodson from the Oakland Raiders, safety Marquand Manuel from the Seattle Seahawks, defensive tackle Ryan Pickett from the St. Louis Rams, and linebacker Ben Taylor from the Cleveland Browns.</p><p align=justify>Despite the offseason criticism preceding the 2007 season, Thompson and the Packers were the surprise team of the NFL through the 2007 season, as they finished the regular season with a 13–3 record. The Packers made it to the NFC Championship game, losing to eventual Super Bowl champions the New York Giants, 23–20 in overtime.</p><h2>Who is Ted Thompson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ted Thompson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

McCarthy also served as quarterback coach for the Packers in 1999, giving him hands-on experience with franchise quarterback Brett Favre and some familiarity with Thompson. The hiring was considered a surprise to many in NFL circles, as McCarthy was not considered a prime head coaching candidate despite the number of head coaching vacancies.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ted Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Sports Executive</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Ted Thompson celebrates birthday on January 17 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In the 2007 NFL Draft, Thompson selected University of Tennessee defensive tackle Justin Harrell with the #16 overall selection in the first round. This move was a surprise selection to many fans because Harrell was not a widely known player, had a long history of injury, and many felt the team had more pressing needs. Fans and draft prognosticators also widely panned Thompson’s selection of James Jones in the third round. Despite heavy criticism, Jones, and several of Thompson’s other 2007 draft picks, played significant roles for the Packers during the 2007 season. Although Harrell was recovering from a college biceps injury, he played in the Packers’ final five games. Harrell played in seven games in 2007, starting in two. James Jones served as the Packers’ third receiver and finished third among rookies in receiving (47 receptions for 676 yards). Other notable members of the Packers’ 2007 draft class include running backs Brandon Jackson and DeShawn Wynn, who were early season starters for the Packers, Korey Hall, who served as the team’s starting fullback, safety Aaron Rouse, who tallied two interceptions while filling in for injured players, and kicker Mason Crosby, who led the NFL in scoring in 2007.</p><h3>What happened to Ted Thompson?</h3><p>It has not been announced what former Green Bay Packers GM Ted Thompson’s cause of death is.
