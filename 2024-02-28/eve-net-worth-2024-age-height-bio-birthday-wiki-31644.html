In 1999, Eve discussed stripping in an interview with Rolling Stone, saying “that was a hustle, too; there’s a song about it on my album, “Heaven Only Knows.” But I don’t regret it – I was eighteen and confused, going through personal problems. I did it for about a month, and I was glad I did it. It helped me find Eve, helped me get serious. It was depressing – a lot of those girls have three or four kids. I’d sit there and be like, ‘Eve, you don’t belong here, this is not your world.'” Eve’s first musical interest was singing. She sang in many choirs and even formed an all-female singing group (Dope Girl Posse or EDGP) with a manager. This group covered songs from En Vogue and Color Me Badd. The group’s manager suggested that they should start rapping, and Eve stuck with it. After the group split up, Eve began working on a solo career under the name “Eve of Destruction”.</p><p>Her second studio album Scorpion, was released on March 6, 2001.

Additional tensions surfaced when Eve “subliminally dissed” Foxy Brown and Lil’ Kim on her records “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” (2001) and “Double R What” (2002), where she criticized the two for having ghostwriters and further solidified that she, “writes [her] own songs”. In December 2002, Foxy Brown responded to the disses via her unreleased record “Get Off Me”, in which she compared Eve to a yorkie terrier, dubbed her a “jealous bum bitch” and criticized her Alicia Keys-assisted single “Gangsta Lovin'”. That same year, Brown reportedly disapproved of Eve and former friend Charli Baltimore’s “Philly’s Finest”, a remake of Jay-Z and Notorious B.I.G.’s “Brooklyn’s Finest”, in which she felt the two Philly-bred female rappers were “disrespectful”. Brown also stated that when she and Lil’ Kim debuted on the music scene, “everybody all of a sudden wanted a female in their crew”, adding that Eve wasn’t doing that for DMX and Ruff Ryders, simply because it was “just not believable”.</p><p align=justify>Eve’s third album, Eve-Olution, was released by Ruff Ryders Entertainment on August 27, 2002 and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200. The album’s first single, “Gangsta Lovin'”, with Alicia Keys, became her second consecutive number-two hit on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as her third consecutive top ten hit in the United Kingdom. The second single, “Satisfaction” was moderately successful in the United States, reaching number 27 and 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Eve-Olution has sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. and was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2002, Eve appeared on the remixed version of Michael Jackson’s “Butterflies”. She appeared in the action film XXX (2002) and all three Barbershop films (Barbershop, Barbershop 2: Back in Business and Barbershop: The Next Cut). In 2003, Eve starred as a fashion designer called Shelly Williams in the television sitcom, Eve.

Eve also revealed that she had known Brown since 1997 and dubbed her a “wankster” and a “miserable jealous bitch”. Eve lastly added, “Ain’t my fault [Foxy] been out since ’96 & her bank account look the same. Do you ma. You look weak. Do you.” In April 2003, during her interview with Wendy Williams, Foxy Brown revealed that she hated Eve and cited her as the prime reason why she broke up with Kurupt because Eve “snitched” about the alleged affair between her and DMX. Brown later made derogatory comments about Eve throughout the interview, calling the rapper a “poorly dressed nappy headed blond chick”. Brown also added that she was “sick and tired” of Eve subliminally dissing her and Lil’ Kim on records because she and Kim “changed the game of hip-hop for female rappers”.
