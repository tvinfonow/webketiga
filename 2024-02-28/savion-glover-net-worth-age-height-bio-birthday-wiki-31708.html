It is riding with the rhythm. It is a pulse that keeps one rolling with the beat.” Gregory Hines, a tap legend, was one of Glover’s tap teachers. Hines stated that “Savion is possibly the best tap dancer that ever lived.” Glover liked to start his pieces with some old school moves from famous tappers and then work his way into his own style. Hines said it’s like paying homage to those he respects. When Honi Coles died, Savion performed at his memorial service. He finished his dance with a famous Coles move, a backflip into a split from standing position, then getting up without using one’s hands. Glover rarely does this move because it wasn’t his style, but he did it because it was Coles’ style that he wanted to keep alive. “I feel like it’s one of my responsibilities to keep the style.” Henry LeTang called Glover “the Sponge” because he learned very quickly with everything thrown at him. LeTang taught the Hines brothers back in the 1950s and taught Glover for a little while before having him work for “Black and Blue,” a tap revue in Paris in 1987. Many legendary tappers taught Glover such as LeTang, the Hines brothers, Jimmy Slyde, Dianne Walker, Chuck Green, Lon Chaney (Isaiah Chaneyfield), Honi Coles, Sammy Davis Jr., Buster Brown, Howard Sims, and Arthur Duncan.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Savion Glover height</b> Not available right now.
