He entered the draft with one year of college eligibility left. The Buccaneers later agreed to terms with Freeman on a five-year, $26 million contract, with another possible $10 million in incentives and bonuses. On November 8, 2009, Freeman started his first professional game at home against the Green Bay Packers. The Buccaneers won by a score of 38–28, ending an 11-game losing streak. He completed 14 out of 31 passes for 205 yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception, including a fourth down touchdown pass to rookie Sammie Stroughter to take the lead, 31–28 late in the game. Freeman became the youngest quarterback in franchise history to start and win his first game.

The Buccaneers began the season with a disappointing 0-3 record, and Freeman was completing 46% of his passes with a near league bottom 59.3 rating (30th). Trouble was already brewing coming into this season; aside from reports of a growing rift with Schiano, Freeman missed the team photo and his teammates did not select him as a team captain for the first time since his rookie campaign.
