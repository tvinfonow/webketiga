A sidestage spat with Placebo singer Brian Molko led to Durst asking the crowd to chant “Placebo sucks!” prior to Placebo’s performance. Molko later commented that nobody had told him that Durst would be compering the show and that Placebo would have to follow opening act Kid Rock. The feud was reignited during Big Day Out 2001, on which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit. By 2004, the feud had ended.</p><p>Durst was accused of insulting fans of the band Slipknot in 1999 by referring to them as “fat, ugly kids”. Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a concert in New York by claiming that the fans of Slipknot “for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit, maybe.” Taylor went on to claim that insulting the fans of Slipknot could also be insulting the fans of Limp Bizkit themselves. In a later interview, Corey mentions Durst is a good business man, but he is not an artist. Corey also mentioned that it is not because of him as a person but it was because of what he was doing, which he claimed was because he was “processing music that other kids feel.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Fred Durst height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Fred <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1994, Durst, Malachi Sage bassist Sam Rivers, and Rivers’ cousin John Otto jammed together and wrote three songs.
