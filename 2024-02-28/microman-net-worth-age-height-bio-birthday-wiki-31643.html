Microman has dwarfism and competes in CMLL’s little people-exclusive Micro-Estrellas (“Micro Stars”) division. He is the son of KeMonito, also a little person, who works as a mascota in CMLL. His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.</p><p>Micro Man was voted the first runner up for the 2017 Wrestling Observer Newsletter rookie of the year awards, second to only Katsuya Kitamura. While the CMLL 86th Anniversary Show in general was given mediocre reviews the match between Micro Man and Chamuel was well received. Richard Gallegos of the “Voices of Wrestling” stated that “Microman and Chamuel saved the night with their fantastic Apuestas Match”. and a Cage Side seats review named the match the “match of the night”. CBS news described Microman as the “pequeña gran estrella de la Lucha Libre,”, or “Little big star of professional wrestling” in a 2018 article. Súper Luchas magazine described his, and the Micro Estrellas debut, as “an encounter with a fall that literally stole the night.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Microman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Claytor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1998</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>KeMonito</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Microman ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
