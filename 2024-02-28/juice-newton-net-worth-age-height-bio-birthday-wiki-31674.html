Neither the record nor its sole single “Hey Baby” charted, though Capitol Records proceeded to renew Newton’s contract. Capitol’s investment in Newton began to pay off in 1979, when Newton had her first Top-40 Country hit with “Let’s Keep It That Way” (another one-off single). Later that year, the album Take Heart featured five modestly charting singles: “Until Tonight”; “Any Way That You Want Me”; “You Fill My Life”; “Lay Back In The Arms of Someone”; and “Sunshine.” The last became Newton’s second top-40 single on the country charts in 1980, with “You Fill My Life” reaching No.&nbsp;41 and “Until Tonight” reaching No.&nbsp;42. Both of Newton’s initial solo efforts performed with modest success but failed to have lasting impacts on the album charts.</p><h2>Juice Newton Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Juice Newton is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.

The songs were also sizable hits in Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries. For example, “Angel of the Morning” peaked at No. 1 in Canada and No. 43 in the UK Singles Chart in 1981. While “The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known)” failed to receive a U.S. certification, the song’s popularity propelled album sales from Gold to Platinum, and the recording remained in the Top 40 (of the Hot 100) for 18 weeks. “Shot Full Of Love” was released as a single in the UK, but failed to chart.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Juice Newton height</b> Not available right now.
