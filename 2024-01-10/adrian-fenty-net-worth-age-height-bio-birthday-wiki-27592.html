Politician and member of the Democratic party who was the sixth ever Mayor of Washington D.C from 2007 to 2011. His tenure as Mayor was marked by widespread education reform.</p><p>He began dating the widow of <a href=#>Steve Jobs</a> after his untimely passing.</p><p>Adrian Malik Fenty (born December 6, 1970) is an American politician who served as the sixth mayor of the District of Columbia. He served one term, from 2007 to 2011, losing his bid for reelection at the primary level to Democrat Vincent C. Gray. Though Fenty won the Republican mayoral primary as a write-in candidate, he declined the Republican nomination and said he would likely not seek elected office again. Gray went on to win the general election for Mayor in the largely Democratic District.</p><p>Education reform was a major focus of Fenty’s mayoral tenure. On the first day of his term, he introduced legislation to vest control of the public schools in himself, rather than the elected school board. Previous attempts to reform the schools, including one in 1996 where a D.C. financial control board took charge of the schools, had failed. At the beginning of Fenty’s term, student test performance scores and graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation and District residents had been demanding that the schools be “fixed”. In April 2007, the D.C.&nbsp;Council approved Fenty’s plan; the necessary legislation was approved by the U.S.&nbsp;Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in May 2007.</p><p align=justify>His parents are Jeanette Bianchi Perno Fenty and Phil Fenty.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Adrian Fenty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Adrian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fenty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington, D.C.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeanette Bianchi Perno Fenty, Phil Fenty</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michelle Cross Fenty</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Matthew Fenty, Andrew Fenty</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Adrian Fenty ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Cropp’s campaign began running negative attack ads during the month before the primary, painting Fenty as unfit for the job and as a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the D.C. Bar, (in 2005, he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999). The attacks backfired. Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary—a feat unparalleled in earlier mayoral elections—defeating Cropp by a 57 to 31 percent margin. He received 89 percent of the vote in the general election and became the District’s sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule.</p><h2>Who is Adrian Fenty Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Adrian Fenty</strong> married to <strong>Michelle Cross Fenty </strong>.

Fenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to city government,, advancing bold ideas for change, and sticking to them. Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor’s office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher’s saying that, “Consensus is the absence of leadership”. Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy. She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus. She criticized Fenty’s proposed approach to governing; being mayor, saying the mayor’s job is “not just standing up and saying, ‘This is what I want done,’ and miraculously it’s going to happen.” Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money&nbsp;– roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006&nbsp;– and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums.</p>You may read full biography about Adrian Fenty from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVflrGztcCnZJ%2BdnqnGcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-10%2fadrian-fenty-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27592.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/2024-01-10/aimee-garcia-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27571.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/2024-01-10/aimee-garcia-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27571.html>Aimee Garcia Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/2024-01-10/a-ja-wilson-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27574.html>A'ja Wilson Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/2024-01-10/a-ja-wilson-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-27574.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
