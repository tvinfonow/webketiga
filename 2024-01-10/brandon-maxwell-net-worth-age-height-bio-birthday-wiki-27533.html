Together they revealed four dramatic outfit changes on the red carpet. Lady Gaga first appeared in an attention-grabbing fuchsia gown with a billowing 25-foot train and an oversized bow. Brandon then unzipped her gown to reveal a second, equally dramatic look- an all-black gown with a matching umbrella. Brandon then revealed her third outfit- a bright pink column gown, which she wore with oversized sunglasses and a vintage mobile phone. She then stripped down to a Swarovski-encrusted black bra and underwear, complete with fishnet tights, and a pair of extra high platform boots- all complete with an entourage of back-up dancers. Maxwell generated the highest earned media value for the MET Gala- earning $3.5 million.</p><p>Brandon Maxwell released his Fall/Winter 2019 Collection, returning to a fundamental palette of black after a splash of colors in the last collection, the Fall Winter 2019 runway show was held in an intimate and minimalist room at the Pennsylvania Hotel, so that the clothes would be the central focus. The collection is primarily in black and white with accents of apple green and bright rose to complement. The runway show began with a number of day wear pieces and then transitioned into evening wear, finishing in a dramatic fashion with a simple, yet elegant, billowing silk ball gown.</p><p align=justify>While pursuing his degree in photocommunications, Maxwell met friend and collaborator, Jessy Price. In school they worked on projects, and this collaboration continues today. Together, Brandon and Jessy photographed and directed their first commercial short film together for the Brandon Maxwell Fall/Winter 2016 campaign. The success of this project lead them to directing Apple Music’s commercial for Lady Gaga’s song “A-Yo” from her 2016 album Joanne. They have continued to direct campaigns for Brandon’s eponymous label that focus on highlighting the featured talent.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brandon Maxwell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brandon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brandon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stylist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brandon Maxwell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
