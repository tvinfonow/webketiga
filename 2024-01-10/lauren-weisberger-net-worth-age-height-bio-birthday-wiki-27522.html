It received generally unfavorable reviews. The New York Times Book Review described it as “fatuous, clunky.” USA Today called it “lackluster imitation,” and Entertainment Weekly said it was “ho-hum rehash.” Despite debuting on The New York Times Best Sellers List at No. 10, it dropped off the list in two weeks and was noted for its disappointing sales. Publisher Simon & Schuster paid Weisberger $1 million for the novel. The audio book was read by actress Eliza Dushku.</p><p>In October 2006, Fox television acquired the television rights to the book, and a television series of the same name had been expected to be developed by Fox in 2007.

The book is a semi-fictional but highly critical view of the Manhattan elite. As of July 2006, The Devil Wears Prada was the best-selling mass-market softcover book in the nation, according to Publishers Weekly. The book is largely based on Weisberger’s experience at Vogue. There is much speculation that the character of Miranda Priestly represents aspects of Anna Wintour. The fictional Elias-Clark publishing company is said to be modeled after Condé Nast.</p><p align=justify>The book was panned by critics and was voted “#1 Worst Book of 2008” by Entertainment Weekly.</p><h2>Who is Lauren Weisberger Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lauren Weisberger</strong> married to <strong>Mike Cohen </strong>.

The film grossed $27.5 million in its opening weekend, amassing total U.S. sales of nearly $125 million and total worldwide sales of $326 million, making it one of the top-grossing films of summer 2006. The film departs from the book in several ways. For example, Andrea is a graduate of Northwestern University in the film, not Brown. The film shows Miranda requesting Andrea go to Paris with her because Emily is unwell. The book, in further detail, has Emily catching mono, thus not being able to go with Miranda. Further, Lily, Andrea’s best friend, is the main reason Andrea leaves Paris in the book. Lily is an alcoholic and gets into a car crash. Andrea has to decide whether to stay with Miranda or go to her friend. The movie does not include any of these details and ends with Andy and Miranda viewing one another with mutual respect. The book affords Andrea no such gratitude as she curses Miranda to her face and is consequently fired.<br>Weisberger made a brief cameo in the film as the twins’ nanny.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Lauren Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Novelist</strong>.
