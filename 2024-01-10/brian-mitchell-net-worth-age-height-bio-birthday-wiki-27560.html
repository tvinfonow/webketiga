Who is Brian Mitchell dating now & how much money does Brian Mitchell have?</p><h2>Brian Mitchell Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Brian Mitchell</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Boxer</strong> who was born on <strong>August 30, 1961</strong> in Johannesburg, Johannesburg, <strong>South Africa</strong>. Mitchell turned pro in 1981 and captured the WBA and Lineal Junior Lightweight Title in 1986 with a 10th-round KO over Alfredo Layne. He defended the title a record 12 times, and never lost a title fight. In 1991 he also captured the IBF Junior Lightweight Title with a decision win over Tony Lopez (who he’d previously fought to a draw). He retired after the fight, and came back briefly in 1994 for two local bouts, retiring completely in 1995 with a professional record of 45-1-3, avenging his loss and three draws in rematches and therefore being one of the few champions to beat everyone they faced.</p><p>He began 1982 with a two-round KO of Phanuel Mosoane, but then suffered a setback, losing over 10 rounds to Jacob Morake. It would prove to be the only loss of his career, and left Mitchell’s record at six wins and one defeat.</p><p>Morake faced Mitchell for the third time in March 1984, and the champion again defended his South African title over 12 rounds. He then disposed of Carlos Miguel Rodriguez in four rounds, and won on points against Iland Matthews over six rounds. Nika Khumalo lasted only two rounds in his title challenge, and Mitchell then outpointed Aladin Stevens over eight rounds. Mitchell opened 1985 with a three-round KO win over Nyungi Mtiya, and then posted two seventh-round knockout wins in succession, defeating Carlos Rodriguez and Vicente Jorge. He improved his record to 25 wins, one loss and one draw when he beat Job Sisanga on points over eight rounds.</p><p>In his next bout, in November 1985, he faced Jacob Morake for the fourth time. It proved to be a tragic fight. Mitchell won on a twelfth-round KO, but Morake had absorbed a terrible amount of punishment and later died of head injuries.</p><p align=justify>He won his next two fights, one on points and one by knockout, but was then held to a draw over six rounds by Frank Khonkhobe. In October 1982, he met Khonkhobe in a rematch and won on a 10-round decision.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brian Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Johannesburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Johannesburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Africa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Juanita Mitchell</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brian Mitchell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
