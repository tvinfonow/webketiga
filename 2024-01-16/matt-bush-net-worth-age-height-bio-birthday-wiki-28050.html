Matthew Brian Bush (born February 8th 1986) is an American professional baseball player who is part of the Texas Rangers organization.&nbsp;The Texas Rangers have played him in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers.&nbsp;He was selected to the San Diego Padres with the first overall draft selection in the year 2004’s Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>Bush had a tough time in 2007, registering an .583 OPS by May 28.&nbsp;The Padres were then able to convert Bush into a pitcher.&nbsp;His fastball was able to reach speeds of the speed of 98 miles/hour (158 km/h) and he also was familiar with pitching since his time as an athlete at high school.&nbsp;Following a successful start to rookie league Bush ruptured a ligament on his elbow that he used to pitch in 2007 and ended his season.&nbsp;Bush had Tommy John surgery, sidelining Bush for the 2008 season as well.&nbsp;The Padres however, decided to add Bush as a member of the team’s 40-man list following the 2008 season in order to prevent his name from being picked for the Rule 5 draft.</p><p>Bush was designated for assignment on February 5, 2009 to make room for Cliff Floyd. Shortly afterward, it was learned that Bush was allegedly intoxicated in a high school parking lot where he assaulted two freshman lacrosse players.</p><p>On January 28, 2010, Bush signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. He played one injury-plagued season for the Class-A Charlotte Stone Crabs in the Florida State League before being added to the Rays’ 40-man roster in November. During the 2011 season, Bush played for the Rays’ Double-A affiliate, the Montgomery Biscuits of the Southern League, primarily as a late reliever and occasional closer. He was promoted to the Rays’ top affiliate, the Durham Bulls, in September, but never appeared during their playoff drive. Bush was slated to begin the 2012 season in Durham, but the Rays placed Bush on the restricted list after a drunken Bush ran over a 72-year-old man during spring training and was released shortly after the 2012 season ended.</p><p align=justify>In 2005, Bush hit .221 in 453 bats with the Fort Wayne Wizards of the Class-A Midwest League.&nbsp;In the spring of 2006, he injured his ankle and was unable to play for the rest of the season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matt Bush</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bush</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Diego</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Daniel Bush, Theresa Bush</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeremy Bush</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Matt Bush ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was sentenced to 51 months in prison. As this was Bush’s third DUI conviction in 10 years, he was banned from driving legally in Florida for 10 years after his release from prison. In the process, Bush turned down a deal that had less prison time (3 years), but with 7 years probation owing to past alcoholism issues.

The Blue Jays, well aware of his behavioral problems, put him on a “zero tolerance” policy. At a party on March 30, he reportedly threw a baseball at a woman’s head and banged on her car window after accusing her of drawing markings on his face at a party in Dunedin, Florida. The Blue Jays released him the next day. He would be out of baseball for the entire 2009 season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Bush attended Mission Bay High School in San Diego, California.

According to witnesses, a drunken Bush beat up a high school lacrosse player with a golf club while screaming, “I’m Matt fucking Bush!,” which was recorded on videotape. This led the Padres to designate Bush for assignment following the team’s signing of Floyd and then trade him to the Blue Jays. Only a month later, he assaulted and berated a woman at a party in Florida, and was released by the Blue Jays for violating a “zero tolerance” agreement. On March 22, 2012, Bush was arrested and charged with two counts of DUI with property damage, one count of DUI with serious bodily injury, one count of leaving the scene of an accident with an injury, one count of driving with a suspended license, and 2 counts of leaving the scene of an accident with damage to property. In the incident, Bush hit 72-year-old motorcyclist Tony Tufano on the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41) northbound in Port Charlotte, Florida, running over his head as he fled the scene in a Dodge Durango belonging to teammate Brandon Guyer. According to a witness, Tufano survived the incident because he was wearing a helmet. Bush was arrested in North Port, three miles down the road from the accident. He was on the road after getting kicked out of a nearby strip club for trying to climb on the stage. When he was arrested, Bush had a blood alcohol content of .18, more than double the legal limit in Florida. Bush spent the 2012 season housed at the Charlotte County Jail on $440,000 bail (reduced from an initial $1.015 million bond), and pleaded not guilty at his arraignment (via closed-circuit TV from the Charlotte County Jail) on May 21. Bush remains a suspect in two other hit and run accidents further north on the Tamiami Trail in Venice that occurred earlier that day. The following Sunday, Rays general manager Andrew Friedman announced that Bush would never play for the Rays organization again. The Rays placed Bush on the restricted list for the 2012 season, meaning that he was no longer on the 40-man roster, nor did he accumulate service time. He was officially released on October 6.</p><p align=justify>On May 13, 2016, Bush was called up to the major leagues by the Rangers. He worked the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays that night, retiring the heart of the Jays lineup (Josh Donaldson, José Bautista, and Edwin Encarnación) by inducing a double-play off the bat of Edwin Encarnación after hitting José Bautista with a pitch. On May 15, Bush earned his first major league win in a 7–6 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, a game more noted for the scuffle between Rougned Odor and José Bautista that would wind up in a bench-clearing brawl. Bush made 58 appearances out of the bullpen in 2016, finishing with a 7-2 record, a 2.48 ERA, and one save.</p><h2>Who is Matt Bush Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Matt Bush</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
