He later changed his surname to a compound surname by hyphenating his middle name Linn with his surname Baker, producing Linn-Baker. His mother, Joan (née Sparks), was a dancer, and his father, William Nelson Baker, co-founded the Open Stage Theater in Hartford. His parents were both active in theatre and participated in civil rights activism. He graduated from Wethersfield High School in Wethersfield, Connecticut, in 1972, and from Yale University in 1976. He then attended the Yale School of Drama, receiving a MFA in Drama in 1979, and following that, found most of his early roles on stage.</p><p>His film debut is a small part in Woody Allen’s 1979 film Manhattan. Unfortunately for Linn-Baker, most of his scenes were later cut from the film. Three years later, he landed a far more memorable film role partly inspired by Allen himself, playing Benjy Stone in the 1982 comedy film My Favorite Year alongside Peter O’Toole. In a manner similar to his future role in Perfect Strangers, Linn-Baker played the straight man to O’Toole’s outrageous character, Alan Swann.</p><p align=justify>He was married to&nbsp;Adrianne Lobel&nbsp;who was the daughter of the writer&nbsp;Arnold Lobel, in the year 1995.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark Linn-Baker</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Linn-Baker</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>St. Louis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Missouri</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>William Nelson Baker, Joan Baker</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Christa Justus , Adrianne Lobel</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark Linn-Baker ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
