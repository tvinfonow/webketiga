Who is Nabeel Qureshi dating now & how much money does Nabeel Qureshi have?</p><h2>Nabeel Qureshi Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Nabeel Qureshi</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Author</strong> who was born on <strong>April 13, 1983</strong> in California, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Beginning in the late 2000s, Qureshi began attending the Dearborn Arab Festival. In 2009, Qureshi, and other members of Acts 17 Apologetics were kicked out of the fair for allegations that they were passing out Christian literature. Different narratives of the issue exist and in the end a court ruled in favour of Qureshi.</p><p>Qureshi was born in San Diego, California to Pakistani Muslim parents who immigrated to the United States. With his father in the U.S. Navy, he moved many times as a youth before settling in Virginia. In 2001 he attended Old Dominion University and served as the president of the Pre-Medical Honor Society. Qureshi also studied Islamic apologetics and engaged Christians in religious discussions. After one such discussion with a Christian at Old Dominion University, David Wood, the two became friends and began a years-long debate on the historical claims of Christianity and Islam. Qureshi’s resulting conversion to Christianity was chronicled in his first book, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus. In addition to being a New York Times bestseller, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus was awarded the Christian Book Award for the categories of both “Best New Author” and “Best Non-Fiction” of 2015, the first time in award history. Christianity Today heralded Qureshi as one of “33 Under 33” in its cover story on emerging religious leaders in July 2014. Qureshi attended medical school at the Eastern Virginia Medical School after graduating from Old Dominion University. After completing his medical degree, Qureshi decided to spend his life studying and preaching the Christian Gospel and became a speaker for the Ravi Zacharias International Ministries. He subsequently completed three more master’s degrees in theology and religious studies and was pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Oxford at the time of his death.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nabeel Qureshi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vanos</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michelle Qureshi</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ayah Qureshi</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nabeel Qureshi ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Furthermore, the members of Acts 17 Apologetics filmed the entirety of their interactions, as they had done the previous year. During the 2010 Festival, Qureshi was shown being asked questions by a small crowd of Muslim teenagers.
