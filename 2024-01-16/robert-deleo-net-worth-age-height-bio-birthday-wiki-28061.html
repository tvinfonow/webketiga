Released in 1997 on Atlantic Records, their eponymous debut album peaked at #131 on the Billboard 200 and was considered a commercial flop. Coutts was eventually fired and the band disbanded.

Purple, their second album, was recorded with his live rig. DeLeo’s usual studio rig for most of Tiny Music… Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop, all of No. 4, and all of Shangri-La-Dee-Da, all by Stone Temple Pilots, was more complicated; he split his signal, bi-amping it to a ’67 50-watt Marshall Plexi guitar head with ’69 Marshall keyboard 8×10 cabinet, and a ’59 Fender Bassman amplifier with a custom 1×15 cabinet. This configuration, which DeLeo noted in a Bass Player Magazine article as being an idea he lifted from Chris Squire of Yes, allowed him to use distorted and clean sounds simultaneously and produce more workable sounds on tape by blending the signals to taste.</p><p>After Stone Temple Pilots’ break-up in 2003, DeLeo and his brother Dean joined Filter frontman Richard Patrick and drummer Ray Luzier to form the band Army of Anyone. The group met after Patrick contacted the DeLeos about writing material for Filter’s fourth album. The band eventually called in Luzier in for an audition, found the formula worked, and the band was formed. The band’s self-titled debut album was released on November 14, 2006. The album became a critical success; some went as far to label the album as one of the best of the year. DeLeo summed up his sound on the album as follows;</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Robert Deleo height</b> Not available right now.

They soon realized that they were both dating the same woman. After she moved to Texas, Weiland and DeLeo moved into her San Diego apartment, where they tried to form a band. They eventually hooked up with drummer Eric Kretz, and DeLeo managed to convince his brother Dean to play guitar in their new band. The band took the name Mighty Joe Young. They played many gigs around LA bars, and were eventually signed onto Atlantic Records in 1992. However, the name “Mighty Joe Young” had already been taken, so the band was forced to change their name to “Shirley Temple’s Pussy” and then “Stone Temple Pilots” which has no specific meaning, according to Weiland other than that it retained the STP initials.</p><p align=justify>However, Army of Anyone ended up going on “indefinite hiatus” in 2007 after disappointing album sales and Patrick’s return to Filter.</p><h2>Who is Robert Deleo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Robert Deleo</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
