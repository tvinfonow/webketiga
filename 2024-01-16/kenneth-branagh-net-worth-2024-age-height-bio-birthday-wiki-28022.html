Who is Kenneth Branagh dating now & how much money does Kenneth Branagh have?</p><h2>Kenneth Branagh Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Director</strong> who was born on <strong>December 10, 1960</strong> in Belfast, <strong>Northern Ireland</strong>. Actor and director who portrayed Hamlet in the 1996 film and directed several other films based on Shakespeare’s plays. His work on the film adaptation of Henry V earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Best Director.</p><p>He starred with <a href=#>Chris Pine</a> in 2014’s Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.</p><p>He attended the amateur Reading Cine & Video Society (now called Reading Film & Video Makers) as a member and was a keen member of Progress Theatre of which he is now the patron. After disappointing A-level results in English, History and Sociology, Branagh nonetheless went on to train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. In 1980 the Principal of RADA, Hugh Cruttwell, asked Branagh to perform a soliloquy from Hamlet for Queen Elizabeth II, during one of her visits to the academy.</p><p>He received acclaim in the UK for his stage performances, first winning the 1982 SWET Award for Best Newcomer, for his role as Judd in Julian Mitchell’s Another Country, after leaving RADA. Branagh was part of the ‘new wave’ of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Jonathan Pryce, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Bruce Payne and Fiona Shaw. In 1984 he appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Henry V, directed by Adrian Noble. The production played to sold-out audiences, especially at the Barbican in the City of London. It was this production that he adapted for the film version of the play in 1989. He and David Parfitt founded the Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987, following success with several productions on the London ‘Fringe’, including Branagh’s full-scale production of Romeo and Juliet at the Lyric Studio, co-starring with Samantha Bond. The first major Renaissance production was Branagh’s Christmas 1987 staging of Twelfth Night at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Richard Briers as Malvolio and Frances Barber as Viola, and with an original score by actor, musician and composer Patrick Doyle, who two years later was to compose the music for Branagh’s film adaptation of Henry V. This Twelfth Night was later adapted for television.</p><p align=justify>He married actress <a href=#>Emma Thompson</a> on August 20, 1989, and later married Lindsay Brunnock on May 24, 2003.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth Branagh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Branagh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belfast</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Northern Ireland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lindsay Brunnock , Emma Thompson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kenneth Branagh ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Critic Milton Shulman of the London Evening Standard wrote: “On the positive side Branagh has the vitality of Olivier, the passion of Gielgud, the assurance of Guinness, to mention but three famous actors who have essayed the role. On the negative side, he has not got the magnetism of Olivier, nor the mellifluous voice quality of Gielgud nor the intelligence of Guinness.”</p><p>From 1989 to 1995, Branagh was married to actress Emma Thompson. They appeared together in Fortunes of War, Look Back in Anger, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Dead Again, and Peter’s Friends.
