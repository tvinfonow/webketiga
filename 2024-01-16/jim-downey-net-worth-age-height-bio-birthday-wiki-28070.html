Downey toured Eastern Europe by train after graduating from Harvard, and returned to the US to work for TV. He is believed to be one of the first Harvard Lampoon writers to get a break in TV and the youngest writer on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Although he was only a credited actor on Saturday Night Live for one season, Downey appeared in over 40 sketches from 1977 to 2005, his most notable being parody commercials such as Craig’s Travellers Checks, First CityWide Change Bank, and Grayson Moorhead Securities. In 2007, he appeared in a Digital Short titled Andy’s Dad, where he portrayed the father of cast member Andy Samberg, and had a romantic relationship with guest star Jonah Hill.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jim Downey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lewis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Writer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Betty McLoughlin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert Downey Sr.</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jim Downey ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>While at Harvard, Downey wrote for the Harvard Lampoon where he later became president, at a time when (as Steve O’Donnell said in 1987) “the proliferation of cable and the proliferation of comedy [led] the sensibilities of the Lampoon [to become] a little closer to the sensibilities of the mass media.” Downey, a member of that first generation of Lampoon writers to make a career in television, has been credited with playing a role in the shift. In 1976, 100 Years of Harvard Lampoon Parodies was published in magazine format, edited by Downey and Eric Rayman. In 1976, Downey became a writer for Saturday Night Live. He worked on 27 of the show’s first 32 seasons, one of the longest tenures in the show’s history. He arrived at Saturday Night Live the same week as Bill Murray with whom he ended up sharing an office overlooking 50th Street, but he mostly began writing at SNL with Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Dan Aykroyd. His first stretch as writer for the show ran from 1976 to 1980, culminating in a brief stint as a featured cast member. By the 1979–1980 season, Lorne Michaels had lost both Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi to feature film careers, causing him to look to writers like Downey, Tom Schiller, Dan Aykroyd’s brother Peter, Al Franken, Alan Zweibel, and Tom Davis to fill spots as cast members (along with SNL bandleader Paul Shaffer and newcomer Harry Shearer). When Michaels left the show in 1980, so did Downey, along with practically everyone else.</p><h2>Jim Downey Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jim Downey is one of the <strong>richest Writer</strong> from United States.

He continued to write for the show until 2013, pausing only in 2005 to work on a novel. For an October 2000 skit satirizing a recent presidential debate, Downey coined the word “strategery” for then-presidential candidate George W. Bush to say, based on Bush’s reputation for difficulty with public speaking. The word soon began to be used in a tongue-in-cheek fashion by members of Bush’s own administration, as well as by political pundits on both sides, to refer to the Bush administration’s political strategy.</p><p>Some have called Downey more right-wing than his self-description, including Shales, who described him in 2002 as “a Republican” and “pretty conservative”. In the Huffington Post, former SNL head writer Adam McKay called Downey “right wing” and an “Ann Coulter pal”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jim Downey height</b> Not available right now.

He returned to SNL in 1984, serving for a while as head writer. When Norm Macdonald began as Weekend Update anchor in the mid-1990s, Downey wrote exclusively for that segment of the show. Downey and Macdonald subsequently became a team, working away from the rest of the cast and crew. They were both fired from the show in 1998 at the request of NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer. Downey believes that it was a result of various jokes on Weekend Update calling O.J. Simpson a murderer; Ohlmeyer was a good friend of Simpson’s.</p><p align=justify>In early 2008, Downey wrote sketches for SNL mocking the then-ongoing Democratic Presidential Debates, that depicted the news media as biased toward Obama. After the first sketch aired, candidate Hillary Clinton referred to it at the beginning of the next debate. The sketches were controversial; McKay suggested that they were a ploy to favor Republicans, since Clinton would be a weaker candidate than Obama. In response, Downey “said he probably favored Mr. Obama over Mrs. Clinton, but that he genuinely felt she was receiving tougher treatment from the news media”. He denied that SNL had intended to help Clinton. According to the Project for Excellence in Journalism the SNL sketches may have prompted tougher news coverage of Obama.</p><h2>Who is Jim Downey Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jim Downey</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Jim Downey celebrates birthday on October 6 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Given Downey’s role in writing much of the political humor featured on Saturday Night Live during his tenure there, his own political leanings have been a source of speculation. Downey has said that he began his career as “a standard-issue Harvard graduate commie”, but later turned into “a conservative Democrat”. He is a registered Democratic Party member. In 2008 he expressed his support for then-Presidential-candidate Barack Obama. Nonetheless, his comedic targets have included American politicians across the political spectrum. TV critic Tom Shales, author of the book Live from New York: The Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, called Downey, and SNL, an “equal opportunity slasher” in political comedy.</p><h3>Is Morton Downey Jr the father of Robert Downey Jr?</h3><table readability=1><tr>Morton Downey Jr.</tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>4</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Parent(s)</td><td>Morton Downey Barbara Bennett</td></tr></table><h3>Are Robert Downey and Jim Downey related?</h3><table readability=1><tr>Jim Downey</tr><tr readability=2><td>Relatives</td><td>Robert Downey Sr. (half-brother) Robert Downey Jr. (nephew)</td></tr></table><h3>Is Jim Downey married?</h3><p><b>Andrea Da-Hae Park and James Wright Downey were married Sept.</b> <b>28</b> in Hudson, N.Y.</p><h3>How old is Jim Downey?</h3><p>69&nbsp;years (October 6, 1952)</p><h3>How old was Morton Downey Jr when he died?</h3><p>68&nbsp;years (1932–2001)</p>You may read full biography about Jim Downey from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfn7auecOorqedqWKwsLnEnaCapl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-16%2fjim-downey-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28070.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=/2024-01-16/jim-maxwell-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28044.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=/2024-01-16/jim-maxwell-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28044.html>Jim Maxwell Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=/2024-01-16/jerry-norton-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28032.html>Jerry Norton Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=/2024-01-16/jerry-norton-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-28032.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
