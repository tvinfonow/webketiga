She is from a suburb of Portland.</p><p>Hoping to jump-start their career, Bruno took young indie upstarts IRONTOM out on tour in 2015 with AWOLNATION. During a conversation between Aaron and some of the members of IRONTOM on this tour, there were talks of the two possibly collaborating on a song. Bruno remembers being stressed wondering if there would be any time to work on a song, or if it would feel right. Sometime after that, both started working on songs. Aaron is currently in the studio with IRONTOM producing the followup to their debut record. The single “Be Bold Like Elijah” has been released through IRONTOMs various social media accounts. Aaron has mentioned in late 2016 that he was able to get IRONTOM a record deal, and at the time he is currently finished producing the new album named “Partners” released in 2017. Bruno can be heard in the final song on the album, entitled “Old And New Songs”.

In 2011 the album Megalithic Symphony was released. In March 2015, AWOLNATION released their second album, entitled “Run”. Bruno, with some help from his engineer, recorded the entirety of the new album by himself, doing not only the vocals but also the instrumentals and the writing for the new release. Their third album “Here Come The Runts” was released early 2018.</p><p align=justify>In light of Awolnation canceling a summer tour to instead go on the road with Prophets of Rage, Bruno explained in an August 2016 interview that Rage Against the Machine was a major influence on him as a child in the early 1990s. He says that Metallica was big at that point in time, but he had already been listening to heavier underground music. He also mentions that he was getting into more hip hop, and loved that singer Zack de la Rocha was into hardcore music as well, saying “The first time I heard what I think was “Killing in the Name” I thought it was a Beastie Boys’ song. It just blew my mind”. Bruno believes Rage was the only band that was able to blend screamed vocals with hip hop beats. He mentions that everything that came after that was “not as authentic”, referencing the nu metal genre that would blossom in the coming years. Bruno continues to say that he believes the riff to “Bulls on Parade” is the greatest riff of all time. While on this tour, Bruno covered Bruce Springsteen’s “The Ghost of Tom Joad” (famously covered by Rage Against the Machine) and Rage’s own “Bullet in the Head” and “Freedom” with Prophets of Rage.</p><h2>Who is Aaron Bruno Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Aaron Bruno</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
