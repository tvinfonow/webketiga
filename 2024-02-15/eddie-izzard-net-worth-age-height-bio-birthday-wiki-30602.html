Izzard started to publicly identify as transvestite in venues such as the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992. His stance is that the way he dresses is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He said “I don’t call it drag; I don’t even call it cross-dressing. It’s just wearing a dress. … It’s not about artifice. It’s about me just expressing myself.” He remarks in his show Unrepeatable that “women wear what they want and so do I”. He has expressed a personal conviction that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having gone so far as to have his own genome sequenced.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Eddie Izzard height</b> <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> Eddie <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1987, Izzard made his first stage appearance at the Comedy Store in London.
