Former goalie who played with the NHL from 1981 until 1992. He also experienced professional sports with the most horrifying injuries.</p><p>Another well-known NHL hockey player&nbsp;Another famous NHL hockey player is <a href=#>Sidney Crosby</a>..</p><p>Clint Malarchuk (born May 1, 1961) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1981 and 1992. He has been a coach for four NHL teams and two minor league teams, most recently the Calgary Flames. He was born in Grande Prairie, Alberta, raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and lives in Alberta and Nevada.</p><p>Malarchuk made his NHL debut with the Nordiques on December 13, 1981, getting the start in goal in a road game against the Buffalo Sabres. The Nordiques were dissatisfied with back-up goaltender Michel Plasse at the time and decided to give Malarchuk a look, in spite of his young age (he had just turned 20 a few months earlier). He did well enough in his first game, a 4-4 tie, but the second one, two days later, was a lot tougher, as he faced the defending Stanley Cup champions, the New York Islanders. The Nordiques favored a wide-open style of play at the time, and Malarchuk was left largely to his own devices and faced 37 shots, letting 10 goals past him, in a wild 10-7 loss, in what was the highest scoring game in the history of the Nassau Coliseum. Having failed his audition, he was returned to the American Hockey League after that game and did not come back until the following season. Quebec traded Plasse to the Hartford Whalers later that season in return for John Garrett, addressing the team’s need for a reliable back-up goaltender for Dan Bouchard.</p><p align=justify>After his retirement, he was the assistant coach for Calgary Flames.

He became the Nordiques’ primary goaltender in 1985-86, keeping the job for two seasons, although there was continual controversy over whether he or local favorite Mario Gosselin should be the starter. In a statistical quirk, during the 1984 NHL Playoffs, he was not credited with a game played but still was assessed with 15 penalty minutes. In Game 6 of the Adams Division Finals against the Montreal Canadiens on April 20, he was handed both a major penalty and a game misconduct for leaving his team’s bench to take part in an on-ice brawl. He was traded to the Washington Capitals after the 1986-87 season alongside Dale Hunter in return for Gaétan Duchesne, Alan Haworth and a first-round choice in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft that eventually landed the Nordiques Joe Sakic. Then, on March 6, 1989, Malarchuk was traded to the Buffalo Sabres along with Grant Ledyard and a 1991 sixth round pick (Brian Holzinger) in exchange for Calle Johansson and a 1989 second-round pick (Byron Dafoe). It was sixteen days later in just his sixth game with the Sabres that Malarchuk would suffer a notorious life-threatening neck injury.</p><h2>Clint Malarchuk Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Clint Malarchuk is one of the <strong>richest Hockey Player</strong> from Canada.
