The word “buffalo” was modified to “bison”, by the commenter D4P on Jon Weisman’s Dodgers blog, Dodger Thoughts, as it is a more proper term for the North American mammal to which the moniker refers. It wasn’t until the next day when the starting lineup did not include Kemp that baseball writer Eric Enders, also commenting in Dodger Thoughts added the capitalized article in front of the animal, completing the nickname, writing “So much for looking forward to watching The Bison tonight.”</p><h2>Who is Matt Kemp Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Matt Kemp</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
