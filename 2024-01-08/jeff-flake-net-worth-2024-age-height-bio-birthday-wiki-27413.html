Shortly after being elected for a third time, Flake announced in early 2005 that he had changed his mind on pledging term limits and was planning to run for reelection in 2006. “It was a mistake to limit my own terms,” Flake said.</p><h2>Jeff Flake Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jeff Flake is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jeff Flake</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He attended Brigham Young University and was a Mormon missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Africa in the early 1980s.</p><p align=justify>In October 2008, Esquire named him one of the Ten Best Members of Congress and in 2010 and he was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” ban on openly gay service members.</p><p align=justify>Jeffry Lane Flake (born December 31, 1962) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Arizona from 2013 to 2019.

The district, which included most of the East Valley, was then renumbered as the 6th district as Arizona gained two Congressional seats because of the results of the 2000 census. Flake easily defeated his primary challenger.</p><p>Flake voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution (authorizing the Iraq War) in the House of Representatives in October 2002. In a debate on the House floor on the authorization of force (October 8, 2002), Flake said, “We ought to let history be our guide here. But the most recent history in this case that we ought to look at is the vote that took place in this Chamber 12 years ago. During that time, we faced a very similar decision. Should we thwart Saddam Hussein in his attempt to go beyond his boundaries or should we appease him? Fortunately, the majority of this body and the other body agreed we ought to thwart him; and I think we can all agree that, had we not done so, that the biological and chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein possesses would be added to nuclear weapons which he would certainly possess today had he not been thwarted at that time. We are in this position today, I would submit, because we have no other choice. This is our only reasonable option. War will no doubt come at great cost. When we visit the war memorials, we see that cost, but the cost of appeasement is far greater. I commend the House leadership for bringing this resolution forward and for shepherding it through process. I especially commend our President who so forcefully pushed for this resolution and who has so deliberately pushed for this resolution. I urge support for the resolution.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jeff Flake height</b> Not available right now.

His uncle, Jake Flake, served in both houses of the Arizona state legislature, including as speaker of the state house.</p><p align=justify>After the 2006 election in which Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives largely due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq, Flake changed his position on the Iraq War to one of cautious opposition, including voting against appropriations. At a 2008 congressional hearing featuring General David Petraeus, Flake said, “I still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success [in Iraq]. That’s not just one side of the aisle with those kind of concerns. Many on this side of the aisle have that as well.”</p><h2>Who is Jeff Flake Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jeff Flake</strong> married to <strong>Cheryl Flake </strong>.

Republicans should learn from him, and liberals and libertarians will find in him a strong privacy-rights ally.” During the 2005 debate on renewal of the expiring provisions of the USA Patriot Act, Jeff Flake successfully submitted several amendments to the bill in the House of Representatives. One required the FBI director to personally sign off on any request for library and bookstore records before applying to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but it was altered in the United States Senate version of the bill. Two of his amendments were signed into law and they subjected any National Security Letter and its gag order to a judicial challenge by the recipient, and narrowed the scope of “Sneak and Peek” warrants to have definite time limits on their duration and extensions before they need to notify the target of the investigation. Before that, “Sneak and Peek” warrants could be extended by the standard of not “unduly delaying trial” without any defined time limitation. This amended bill was titled the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and it was signed into law on March 9, 2006. This bill also required three Inspector General investigations that led to the discovery of exigent letters and National Security Letter abuses. On February 8, 2011, Flake voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The vote failed. On February 10, 2011, Flake again voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. This vote succeeded.</p><h2>Top Facts about Jeff Flake</h2><li>Jeff Flake is an American diplomat and politician born in 1962.</li><li>He served as a U.S. Senator from Arizona from 2013-2019.</li><li>Flake was a member of the Republican Party.</li><li>He was known for his criticism of President Trump.</li><li>Flake authored the book “Conscience of a Conservative” in 2017.</li><li>In 2020, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.</li><li>Flake has also worked as a lobbyist and political commentator.</li><li>He graduated from Brigham Young University and earned a law degree from the University of Arizona.</li><li>Flake is married with five children.</li><li>He currently serves on the board of directors for several organizations, including CBS Corporation and the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Jeff Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Politician</strong>.
