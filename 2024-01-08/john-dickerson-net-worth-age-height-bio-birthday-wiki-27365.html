Another reporter, Tamara Lipper of Newsweek, reportedly walked away before he spoke of Plame. Dickerson has disputed Fleischer’s account, claiming that Fleischer urged him to look into who sent Wilson but that he did not mention Plame’s name or CIA identity. In a second trial dispatch on the matter, Dickerson revealed a previously-undisclosed excerpt from his email that July afternoon which he said corroborated his account: “On background WH officials were dissing Wilson. They suggested he was sent on his mission by a low-level person at the agency.” Neither Lipper nor Gregory has commented publicly about what Fleischer told them.</p><p>On February 29, 2008, Senator Hillary Clinton released a “red phone” television ad suggesting that her opponent, Senator Barack Obama, was unprepared to be President. On a conference call with Clinton staff, Dickerson asked, “What foreign policy moment would you point to in Hillary’s career where she’s been tested by crisis?” The question prompted—according to The Hotline—a “pregnant pause” so long “you could’ve knit a sweater in the time it took the usually verbose team of Mark Penn, Howard Wolfson and Lee Feinstein, Clinton’s national security director, to find a cogent answer.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>John Dickerson height</b> Not available right now.
