She spent most of her career at the BBC and was the corporation’s Personality of the Year in 1997. At the time of her death, her television work included co-presenting the BBC One programme Crimewatch with Nick Ross.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Dando’s funeral took place on 21 May 1999 at Clarence Park Baptist Church in Weston-super-Mare. She was buried next to her mother in the town’s Ebdon Road Cemetery. The gross value of her estate was £1,181,207; after her debts and income tax, the value was £863,756; after inheritance tax, it was £607,000, all of which her father inherited because she died intestate.</p><p>Soon after the murder, some commentators identified the possibility of a Yugoslav or Serb connection. The origin of the theory turned out to be a viewer’s letter recalled by Allasonne Lewis, Dando’s agent, complaining that a Disasters Emergency Committee appeal fronted by Dando had been one-sided. It contained no hint of threat, but the story that reached the media was that it was extremely menacing. Nonetheless, at George’s first trial, his defence barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, proposed that the Serbian warlord leader Arkan had ordered Dando’s assassination in retaliation for the NATO bombing of Radio Television of Serbia’s headquarters on 23 April 1999. Sixteen station staff had died in the bombing. Mansfield suggested that Dando’s earlier presentation of an appeal for aid for Kosovar Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jill Dando height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Jill <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Dando’s first job was as a trainee reporter for the local weekly newspaper, the Weston Mercury, where her father and brother worked.
