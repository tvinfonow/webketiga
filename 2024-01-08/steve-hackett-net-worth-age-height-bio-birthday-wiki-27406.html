Hackett contributed to six Genesis studio albums, three live albums, seven singles and one EP before he left to pursue a solo career. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.</p><p>Hackett’s first professional playing experience came as a member of three rock bands: Canterbury Glass, with whom he played on “Prologue” on their album Sacred Scenes and Characters which was recorded in 1968 but distributed in 2007; Heel Pier; and Sarabande, all of whom performed rock with progressive rock elements. He then joined Quiet World in 1970 which featured his brother John on flute. He did not write any material with the group as the band’s founders directed what the other members played, which did not bother Hackett as he wished to get more experience in a recording studio since the band had secured a contract with a label. Hackett played on the band’s only studio album, The Road (1970), released on Dawn Records, and left them soon after.</p><p align=justify>He got married to Kim Poor in 1975 and later Jo in June in 2011.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve Hackett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hackett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pimlico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jo Lehmann , Kim Poor</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Steve Hackett ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It read: “Imaginative guitarist-writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to strive beyond existing stagnant music forms”. It was responded to by Genesis lead vocalist Peter Gabriel. Genesis, which also comprised keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and drummer Phil Collins, had lost founding guitarist Anthony Phillips and sought a new, permanent replacement to his temporary replacement Mick Barnard. Gabriel advised Hackett to listen to their last album Trespass (1970) before Hackett auditioned for the group. Hackett’s first live gig with Genesis took place at City University, London on 24 January 1971.</p><h2>Steve Hackett Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Steve Hackett is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.

Its original title was Premonitions, but management at Charisma disliked it and suggested Voyage of the Acolyte, to which Hackett agreed. The album features Collins and Rutherford on drums and bass, respectively, and reached No.&nbsp;26 in the UK and was certified silver. Hackett enjoyed the freedom he had when writing and recording his own album, but was informed by Rutherford and Banks that he could not continue his solo career while in Genesis. Part of one of the album tracks, “Shadow of the Hierophant”, was rehearsed by Genesis during the writing and recording of Foxtrot. Upon its release Hackett resumed working in Genesis.</p><p>Hackett released his first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte, while still a member of Genesis in 1975. After a series of further solo albums beginning in 1978, Hackett co-founded the supergroup GTR with Steve Howe in 1986. The group released the self-titled album GTR, which peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the Billboard 200 in the United States and spawned the Top 20 single “When the Heart Rules the Mind”.

He helped shape the group’s sound by strongly encouraging them to incorporate a Mellotron into the songs, and his guitar work is prominently featured through solos on “The Musical Box”, “The Return of the Giant Hogweed”, and “The Fountain of Salmacis”. He became an early proponent of the guitar tapping technique normally attributed to Eddie Van Halen. Hackett claimed that Van Halen had told him that he learned the technique after attending a Genesis concert in the mid-1970s. Foxtrot (1972) included Hackett’s guitar solo composition “Horizons”, which he based on a Suite for Cello by Bach. Selling England by the Pound (1973) features Hackett using tapping and sweep picking, later popularised by Yngwie Malmsteen, both of which are used on “Dancing with the Moonlit Knight”. The song “Firth of Fifth” contains one of Hackett’s most well-known guitar solos and has remained a favourite in concert even after Hackett’s departure. The writing sessions for The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) was a difficult time not just for Hackett but the entire group, partly due to the personal lives of some members which affected the mood in the group. Hackett explained: “Everybody had their own agenda. Some of us were married, some of us had children, some of us were getting divorced. And we were still trying to get it together in the country”. Hackett, in particular, was going through a divorce from his first wife. While Gabriel wrote the majority of the lyrics, all the band members co-wrote the music. Hackett had picked out “The Lamia” and “Fly on a Windshield” as his favourite moments on the album.</p><p align=justify>After the Wind & Wuthering tour, Hackett left the band during the mixing stage of the Genesis live album, Seconds Out. His departure was announced in the press during the promotion of the album on 8 October 1977. Hackett has said that he “needed autonomy”.</p><h2>Who is Steve Hackett Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Steve Hackett</strong> married to <strong>Jo Lehmann , Kim Poor </strong>.

Hackett is credited on “Dance on a Volcano”, “Entangled”, and “Los Endos”. The follow-up, Wind & Wuthering (1976), is Hackett’s final studio album with the band. He had grown increasingly constricted by his lack of freedom and level of input and was insistent that more of his material be included on the album, but was rebuffed. Of the nine tracks, he was credited with four: “Eleventh Earl of Mar”, “Blood on the Rooftops”, “Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers…”, and “…In That Quiet Earth”. Another track of Hackett’s, “Please Don’t Touch”, was rehearsed but rejected and replaced with an instrumental, “Wot Gorilla?”.
