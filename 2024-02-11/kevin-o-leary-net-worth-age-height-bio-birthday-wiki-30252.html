Who is Kevin O'Leary dating now & how much money does Kevin O'Leary have?</p><h2>Kevin O'Leary Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kevin O'Leary</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Winegrower</strong> who was born on <strong>July 9, 1954</strong> in Montreal, Montreal, <strong>Canada</strong>. Terence Thomas Kevin O’Leary (born 9 July 1954) is a Canadian businessman, author, politician, and television personality. From 2004 to 2014, he appeared on various Canadian television shows, including the business news programmes SqueezePlay and The Lang and O’Leary Exchange, as well as the reality television shows Dragons’ Den and Redemption Inc. In 2008, he appeared on Discovery Channel’s Project Earth. Since 2009, he has appeared on Shark Tank, the American version of Dragons’ Den.</p><p>The software and personal-computer industries were growing rapidly in the early 1980s, and O’Leary convinced printer manufacturers to bundle Softkey’s program with their hardware. With distribution assured, the company developed a number of educational software products focused on mathematics and reading education. Softkey products typically consisted of software intended for home users, especially compilation discs containing various freeware or shareware games packaged in “jewel-case” CD-ROMs.</p><p>After selling his share of SET, O’Leary started Softkey in a Toronto basement in 1986, along with business partners John Freeman and Gary Babcock. The company was a publisher and distributor of CD-ROM-based personal computer software for Windows and Macintosh computers. A major financial backer who had committed $250,000 in development capital to the company backed out the day before signing the documents and delivering his cheque, which left O’Leary looking for funding to support the fledgling business. He used the proceeds from the sale of his share of SET and convinced his mother to lend him $10,000 in seed capital to establish SoftKey Software Products.</p><p>O’Leary and his wife, Linda, have been married since 1990. The couple separated in 2011, but resumed their marriage after two years. Linda now serves as the VP of Marketing for O’Leary Wines. They have two children. Trevor is a music producer and DJ while Savannah is a multimedia producer at the Huffington Post. In an interview with Inc. Magazine writer Brian D Evans O’Leary stated: “In a successful growing business, it eats your time alive. Then later in life, you can provide for your family things that many others can’t have. But because you sacrificed, you’re then given the reward of freedom.”</p><p align=justify>Softkey weathered stiff competition from other software companies in the late 1980s and prospered throughout the 1990s. By 1993, Softkey had become a major consolidator in the educational software market, acquiring rivals such as WordStar and Spinnaker Software. In 1995, Softkey acquired The Learning Company (TLC) for $606 million, adopting its name, and moved its headquarters to Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin O'Leary</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Winegrower</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Montreal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Montreal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Yanna Lavigne, Bruno Gissoni</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Other Family Members</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Grandparents : Ana Paula Sang, Marcelo Gissoni, Lúcia Lavigne, Paulo Inagaki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda O'Leary</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Trevor O'Leary, Savannah O'Leary</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin O'Leary ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Following the acquisition, Mattel experienced a US$105 million loss where management had projected a $50 million profit. Mattel’s stock dropped, wiping out US$3 billion of shareholder value in a single day. Mattel’s shareholders later filed a class-action lawsuit accusing Mattel executives, O’Leary, and former TLC CEO Michael Perik of misleading investors about the health of TLC and the benefits of its acquisition. The lawsuit alleged that TLC used accounting tricks to hide losses and inflate quarterly revenues. O’Leary and his defendants disputed all of the charges. Mattel paid $122 million to settle the lawsuit in 2003. O’Leary blamed the technology meltdown and a culture clash of management of the two companies for the failure of the acquisition.</p><h2>Kevin O'Leary Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kevin O'Leary is one of the <strong>richest Winegrower</strong> from Canada.
