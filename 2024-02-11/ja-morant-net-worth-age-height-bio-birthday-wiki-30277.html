Who is Ja Morant dating now & how much money does Ja Morant have?</p><h2>Ja Morant Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ja Morant</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Basketball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>August 10, 1999</strong> in South Carolina, South Carolina, <strong>United States</strong>. Versatile guard who gained fame during his time with the Murray State Racers. During his 2018-2019 sophomore season, he became the first Murray State player ever to record multiple triple-doubles. He was selected second overall in the 2019 NBA Draft by the Memphis Grizzlies and went on to win the 2020 NBA Rookie of the Year award.</p><p>He played AAU basketball in South Carolina for a season with <a href=#>Zion Williamson</a>.</p><p>At the end of the regular season, he was named OVC Player of the Year and first-team All-OVC, while leading the NCAA Division I in assists. He later earned first-team All-American honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association and second-team All-American honors from Sporting News. On March 8, in the semifinals of the OVC Tournament versus Jacksonville State, Morant scored 29 points, including a game-winning three-point play. One day later, he recorded 36 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in a 77–65 upset victory over the Belmont Bruins, who were playing without injured first team All-OVC center Nick Muszynski, for the OVC Tournament title. Morant was subsequently named the tournament’s MVP. On March 21, in an 83–64 win over fifth-seeded Marquette in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Tournament, Morant posted 17 points, 11 rebounds, and 16 assists. He became the eighth player to officially record a triple-double in the history of the tournament, and the first player since Draymond Green in 2012. In the second round, he chipped in 28 points in a season-ending 90–62 loss to fourth-seeded Florida State. During the game, Morant set school records for career assists and single-season points. He closed his sophomore campaign averaging 24.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 10 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. Morant became the first NCAA player to ever average at least 20 points and 10 assists per game in a single season.</p><p>Morant was not ranked by recruiting services ESPN, 247Sports, or Rivals. His only high major NCAA Division I offer came from South Carolina. He was accidentally discovered by mid-major program Murray State of the OVC in July 2016, when assistant coach James Kane attended a camp hoping to see a player who was joining his team. While looking for a snack, Kane noticed Morant playing a three-on-three game in an auxiliary gym; impressed, he contacted head coach Matt McMahon, who soon offered Morant a scholarship. On September 3, 2016, Morant committed to playing for Murray State during dinner at McMahon’s house. His father said, “Every parent wants their child to play at a big-time program, but what I realized is, don’t go where you want to be, go to where they want you.” His other Division I offers included Duquesne, Maryland Eastern Shore, South Carolina State, and Wofford.</p><p align=justify>He was born Temetrius Jamel Morant.

He was one of 20 players invited to Chris Paul’s Elite Guard Camp, which Morant called, “an honor.” When his sophomore season began, Morant assumed a leading role for Murray State with the departures of key players Jonathan Stark and Terrell Miller. In his season debut, he recorded 26 points and 11 assists in a 74–53 win against Wright State.

In his next game, he scored a season-high 38 points in a 78–72 loss to Alabama, the 12th-most single-game points by a player in school history. By around December 2018, Morant was almost unanimously projected as a top-five selection in the 2019 NBA draft, and in late January 2019, at least one outlet forecasted him as the first overall selection. At that time, then-Yahoo Sports journalist Pat Forde wrote, “He seems almost certain to be the first top-ten pick from a mid-major school in five years (Elfrid Payton, Louisiana-Lafayette), and could be the first true mid-major pick in the top five since Michael Olowokandi of Pacific went No. 1 in 1998.”</p><h2>Ja Morant Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ja Morant is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.
