Who is Jermaine O'Neal dating now & how much money does Jermaine O'Neal have?</p><h2>Jermaine O'Neal Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jermaine O'Neal</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Basketball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>October 13, 1978</strong> in Columbia, South Carolina, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>O’Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, and Clifford R. Robinson. After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O’Neal made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December. At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that was later eclipsed by Andrew Bynum). O’Neal also became the youngest player at 18 years, three months and eleven days to score 20 points in a game on January 22, 1997, against the Seattle SuperSonics.</p><p>The 1998–99 season was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the collective bargaining negotiations. In the end, the league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign. Boasting one of the league’s most balanced squads that also had strength in depth, the Trail Blazers chalked up an impressive 35–15 record and topped the division. Dunleavy—who would later be named NBA Coach of the Year—led his club into the playoffs aiming to capture the franchise’s first NBA title since 1977. After sweeping the Phoenix Suns 3–0 in the first round, Portland defeated the Utah Jazz 4–2 to set up a showdown with the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. In Game 2, a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott in the closing seconds gave the Spurs an 86–85 win and propelled San Antonio to win the series (the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship). O’Neal’s disappointment at losing in the Conference Finals was compounded by the fact that his regular-season minutes had dropped to fewer than 10 a game for the first time, and that his contributions to the team were mostly insignificant, to begin with. He was having increasing doubts about his NBA career.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jermaine O'Neal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jesse</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hoorelbeke</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Columbia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Clifford O’Neal</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mesha O’Neal</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Asjia O’Neal, Jermaine O’Neal, Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jermaine O'Neal ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The Americans won all of their five games and the gold medal, and O’Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds. The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent his nation again in the 2002 World Basketball Championship which was held in Indianapolis. This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth. O’Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games. The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas. Winning all ten of its games and the gold medal, the team qualified for the 2004 Olympics. O’Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest. While he was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the Olympics, a knee injury prevented him from participating in the games.</p><h2>Jermaine O'Neal Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jermaine O'Neal is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jermaine O'Neal</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Jermaine Gregory O’Neal (born October 13, 1978) is an American retired professional basketball player. The 6&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in (2.11&nbsp;m), 255&nbsp;lb (116&nbsp;kg) forward–center had a successful high school career and declared his eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft straight out of high school. O’Neal, at just 17 years of age, was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the 17th overall pick, and played his first professional game at 18. At the time, he was the youngest player to ever play an NBA game. O’Neal was unable to break into the first team in Portland and was traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2000. In his eight seasons with the club, he was voted an NBA All-Star six times, made the All-NBA teams three times, and was voted the NBA Most Improved Player in the 2001–02 season. O’Neal also helped Indiana reach the NBA Playoffs six times, including the Eastern Conference Finals in the 2003–04 season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just come off an appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven commodity in O’Neal. The Pacers roster also saw the departures of Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Chris Mullin, and even coach Larry Bird stepped down. All of this meant that O’Neal arrived in Indianapolis facing intense pressure and scrutiny. When O’Neal arrived at his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas—who had pushed for the O’Neal/Davis trade—told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed. At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller. O’Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team. Starting in 80 of the 81 regular-season games he played in for the 2000–01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. The big man helped his team to a 41–41 record and the eighth playoff seed; he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record), and led the Eastern Conference in double-doubles. O’Neal kept up his form into the playoffs as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games.</p><p>The 2001–02 season proved to be the breakthrough season for O’Neal as he earned a trio of honors: winning the NBA Most Improved Player Award, being named an NBA All-Star, and making the All-NBA Third Team (becoming the second Pacer in history to do so after Reggie Miller). Leading his team in scoring (19.0) and rebounding (10.5), he chalked up 39 double-doubles, which was third-best in the conference and eighth-best in the league. Indiana recorded 42 wins and qualified for the playoffs once again as the eighth seed, where they faced one of the hottest teams in the league at that time, the New Jersey Nets. The Pacers lost the series in 5 Games, despite forcing overtime twice. The Nets decided to put Kenyon Martin on O’Neal after the latter put up a 30-point, 11 rebound performance in Game 1, and they succeeded by limiting him to just 17.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game for the rest of the series. As the Pacers reflected on yet another premature end to the postseason, they knew that O’Neal was next in line to succeed the 36-year-old Miller as the new face of the franchise. At the same time, the Pacers seemed to have found players in Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley who complemented O’Neal. Indiana was on the brink of becoming a legitimate threat in the East.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jermaine O'Neal height</b> <strong>6 ft 11 in</strong> Jesse <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 11 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, in an unexpected move, Portland showed their willingness to invest in O’Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million. However, the new deal did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the 1999–2000 season. Portland acquired Detlef Schrempf, Scottie Pippen, and Steve Smith during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O’Neal was once again consigned to the bench. His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season. In the meantime, the Trail Blazers continued to build on the success of their previous campaign. They notched 59 wins in the regular season, and defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Utah Jazz en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals. Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter of the pivotal Game 7, and lost 89–84. O’Neal was not heavily involved in any of this action, however. With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded. The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for NBA All-Star Dale Davis.</p><p align=justify>The Pacers started the 2002–03 season well, winning 14 of their first 16 games, and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most versatile players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O’Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season’s end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller’s father-in-law and Tinsley’s mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O’Neal’s stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O’Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O’Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O’Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.</p><h2>Who is Jermaine O'Neal Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jermaine O'Neal</strong> married to <strong>Mesha O’Neal</strong>.

In a game against the Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, a brawl broke out that spilled into the stands. O’Neal was one of the Pacers who fought with some of the fans and was suspended for 25 games by NBA Commissioner David Stern; teammates Artest and Stephen Jackson were suspended for the rest of the season and 30 games respectively. Following an appeal just before Christmas, O’Neal won a ten-game reduction in his sentence, but this did not mitigate the damage that Indiana had already suffered. Stripped of three of its core players, the team hobbled to a 44–38 record and the sixth seed. O’Neal appeared in only 44 games, his lowest total ever with Indiana. Although his scoring average improved to 24.3 points per game, his rebounding dropped and he was no longer the same intimidating presence on defense. Things worsened when he sprained his right shoulder in March and played sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, while hoping to recover in time for the playoffs. The Pacers drew the Celtics in the first round, and managed to salvage their season by winning the series 4–3. O’Neal, however, was not playing as well as he could have: his offensive output dropped, and he shot poorly from the field. When the Pacers met the Pistons in the semifinals, they were eliminated in six games, capping yet another frustrating season for O’Neal.</p><h3>Who did Jermaine O'Neal get traded for?</h3><p>Apparently, the Toronto Raptors have agreed to a trade that would bring Jermaine O’Neal to the Raps along with Indiana’s second round pick (41st overall) for <b>T.J.
