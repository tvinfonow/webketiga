Rooney of Florida, and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia—claimed that Abedin “has three family members—her late father, her mother and her brother—connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.” The five members of Congress alleged that Abedin had “immediate family connections to foreign extremist organizations” which they said were “potentially disqualifying conditions for obtaining a security clearance” and questioned why Abedin had not been “disqualified for a security clearance”.</p><h2>Who is Huma Abedin Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Huma Abedin</strong> married to <strong>Anthony Weiner </strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Huma Abedin!<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, raised questions about Abedin’s work as a State Department employee, concerning the fact that she held four jobs from June 2012 to February 2013. These included serving as a part-time aide to Clinton at the State Department, while also working as a consultant to private clients for the consulting firm Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm run by Douglas Band, a longtime aide to former president Bill Clinton. At the time, she was also being paid a salary for work at the Clinton Foundation, and working as Hillary Clinton’s personal assistant. The State Department and Abedin both responded, with the State Department indicating that it uses special government employees routinely “to provide services and expertise that executive agencies require”, and Abedin stating that she did not provide any government information or inside information gained from her State Department job to her private employers. Grassley said he found the letters unresponsive. In July 2015, Grassley released information indicating that the State Department’s inspector general had found that Abedin was overpaid by almost $10,000 for unused leave time when she left the government, resulting from violations of the rules governing vacation and sick leave during her tenure on the payroll as a Federal employee in the department. Abedin’s attorneys said that she had learned in May that the Department’s inspector general had found that she improperly collected $9,857 for periods when she was on vacation or leave, responded with a 12-page letter contesting the findings, and formally requested an administrative review of the investigation’s conclusions. Her lawyer, Miguel Rodriguez, told The New York Times that the inspector general’s report showed that Abedin worked during her maternity leave and had thus earned that pay.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Huma Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Family Member</strong>.
