Discussing Madonna, Swift said: “One element of Madonna’s career that really takes center stage is how many times she’s reinvented herself. It’s easier to stay in one look, one comfort zone, one musical style. It’s inspiring to see someone whose only predictable quality is being unpredictable.” Swift has named Pete Wentz and Lana Del Rey as her favorite lyricists.</p><p align=justify>Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, “Tim McGraw”.
