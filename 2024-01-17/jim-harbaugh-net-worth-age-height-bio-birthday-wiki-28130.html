In the 1982 season, Smith started all 12 games, and Hall handled the limited backup role. Even as Smith struggled, coach Schembechler expressed a reluctance to play Harbaugh, saying, “To suddenly pull some freshman out of the bag, I don’t think you can do that in today’s football.” Harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the NCAA’s redshirt rule.</p><p align=justify>In the spring of 1984, Harbaugh was in a three-way competition for Michigan’s starting quarterback job.

There’s kind of a battle in there.” In the 1984 spring game, Harbaugh impressed observers as he completed 17 of 26 passes for 161 yards and an interception. Schembechler said after the game, “We’ve been happy with Jim all spring.
