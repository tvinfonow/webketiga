They are more like the two ends of a long thread — part of the same thing. Since the statement was not a direct quote, some have surmised that Card was misunderstood. The impact of this statement can be understood in the context that many Protestants and Catholics categorize Mormons as outside Christianity and consider the LDS church a cult. Card’s response to his critics online did satisfy some, since it denied the quote and the LDS interviewer later admitted to rewording Card’s statement somewhat interpretively.</p><h2>Michael Card Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael Card is one of the <strong>richest Singer-Songwriter</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Card</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Michael Card (born April 11, 1957) is an American, Christian singer-songwriter, musician, author, and radio host from Franklin, Tennessee. He is best known for his contributions in contemporary Christian music, which combine folk-style melodies and instrumentation with an in-depth study of the Bible.

He originally started writing as a way to share the knowledge he accumulated while researching his songs. He found his studies were too in-depth to condense everything he had learned into one short piece. The books that resulted from album research bear the same titles as the albums. He then branched out to other subjects not specifically based on his music, such as the Gospel of John, homeschooling, and Christian discipleship and mentoring. In 2014, Card completed the Biblical Imagination Series, a four-volume set which takes a deeper look at each of the gospels and the voice of the writers behind them. He followed up on the Biblical Imagination Series next by releasing a new book (and album) on the subject of the Hebrew word hesed (Hebrew: חֶסֶד), an idea which he first explored in his two books on lament (A Sacred Sorrow and The Hidden Face of God). The book was called Inexpressible: Hesed and the Mystery of God’s Lovingkindness, and was released at the end of 2018.</p><p>In addition to touring and writing, Card also hosted a weekly radio program, In the Studio with Michael Card. It was carried by stations in 48 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. It was also available via Internet streaming audio and as a podcast. The show was an amalgam of talk, musical performances, and Bible study. The show ceased production in March 2009 but was then revived in the form of a podcast on June 18, 2018, with a mix of completely new and classic material.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Card height</b> Not available right now.
