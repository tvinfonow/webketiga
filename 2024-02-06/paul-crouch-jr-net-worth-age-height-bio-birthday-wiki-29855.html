Who is Paul Crouch Jr. dating now & how much money does Paul Crouch Jr. have?</p><h2>Paul Crouch Jr. Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Paul Crouch Jr.</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Businessperson</strong> who was born on <strong>March 13, 1959</strong> in Rapid City, South Dakota, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>The oldest of Paul and Jan Crouch’s two children, Crouch Jr. was born in Rapid City, South Dakota, where his father was working in commercial broadcasting at the time. The Crouches eventually moved to California, where they co-founded Trinity Broadcasting Network in 1973.</p><p>As a teenager, Crouch worked behind the scenes during the formative years of TBN, alongside his parents and younger brother Matthew. In the early 1980s, however, he left TBN and ventured out on his own to produce and direct various Christian television programs such as Church in the Home for Fred Jordan and a program for TBN regular Dwight Thompson. Around this time, in 1982 Crouch briefly entered the spotlight as an outspoken critic of backmasking. He made appearances on both religious networks (including TBN) and secular programs, such as The Merv Griffin Show, playing rock music recordings he believed contained Satanic messages when played backwards. (To this end Paul Crouch, Jr., points out that Aleister Crowley, a well-known Satanist/Occultist, has been pictured top row, second from the left—one of 11 Free Masons, others of which Crouch doesn’t mention—on the Beatles “Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Heart Band” record album cover. Another memorable reference of many he made was of “When Electricity Came To Arkansas” by Black Oak Arkansas. It allegedly says, “Satan Satan Satan,” three times as “Natas”. His purpose was to show what was often the seeming influence and messages actually heard in secular music like Blondie’s song “Die Young Stay Pretty” and other lyrics, as well as the John Lennon song “Imagine.” He would recommend listening to and following CCM—Contemporary Christian Music—in contrast.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Crouch Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ndjofang</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapid City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Dakota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paul Crouch, Jan Crouch</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Matt Crouch, Andrew Crouch</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brenda Crouch , Tawny Dryden Crouch</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brittany Koper, Brandon Crouch, Carra Crouch</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Crouch Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
