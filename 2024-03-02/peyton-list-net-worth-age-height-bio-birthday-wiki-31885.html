Most well known for her portrayal of Jane Siegel Sterling on the acclaimed AMC series Mad Men, she is also notable for her roles as Cara Coburn and Nicole Kirby on the respective television shows The Tomorrow People and FlashForward.

The younger List was interviewed by Access Hollywood, saying she uses Peyton R. List to avoid confusion. Union SAG-AFTRA’s policy avoids actors with the same name; this instance went unnoticed. They appeared in the same scene — when the older List starred on As the World Turns as Lucy Montgomery. Years later, the younger List cited confusion when they stayed at the same hotel — they received daily call sheets and voicemails for each other. IndieWire noted the confusion appeared on the website Wikipedia, where both actresses’s articles started out with exactly the same introduction text of: “Peyton List is an American actress and model.”</p><p>List had a minor role in the HBO television series Sex and the City in 2000. The following year, she played a small part in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, and started a three-year run as Lucy Montgomery on the CBS soap opera As the World Turns.
