Canucks head coach Tom Watt was not impressed with Neely’s defense, and that was what made him tradeable.

Compounding the situation was the fact that Neely developed myositis ossificans in the injured area. The injury kept Neely out of all but 22 games of the next two seasons, and Neely would only play a total of 162 NHL games for the remainder of his career after the hit because of knee trouble.</p><h2>Cam Neely Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Cam Neely is one of the <strong>richest Hockey Player</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Cam Neely</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His parents both died of cancer. He became a strong advocate for cancer research.</p><p align=justify>He scored his 50th goal in his 44th game of the 1993-1994 season; Wayne Gretzky is the only player to have 50 more goals in a single season.</p><p align=justify>Cameron Michael Neely (born June 6, 1965) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player.

The Bruins have since retired #8 in his honor, making him the tenth player to have a number retired by the team. Despite his shortened career, he recorded some remarkable scoring feats. Only Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Brett Hull scored a better goals per game average over the course of an NHL season than Neely did with his 50-goals-in-49-games in the 1993–94 season (despite missing 35 games that season). Also, only ten players in NHL history scored a better goals per game average over their career than Neely. He reached the fifty goal mark three times, played in five All-Star games, and was named the league’s Second Team All-Star at right wing in 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1994.</p><p>In the 1993–94 season, Neely scored his 50th goal in his 44th game; only Wayne Gretzky has scored 50 goals in fewer games. This milestone is unofficial as the 50 goals must be scored in the first 50 games the team plays, counting from the start of the season. Other players have also “unofficially” reached this milestone, such as Alexander Mogilny, Jari Kurri, and Bobby Hull. He was regularly listed as a healthy scratch in alternate games in order to rest his ailing knee, but it would be a degenerative hip condition that forced Neely to retire after the 1995–96 season at the age of 31.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Cam Neely height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Cam <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Neely was born in Comox, British Columbia and grew up in Maple Ridge, British Columbia.
