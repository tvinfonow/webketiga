Mongeau intended TanaCon to be an alternative to VidCon after the VidCon 2017 organizers failed to give Mongeau the rights at the convention of a “featured creator”. TanaCon took place in Anaheim, California, at the Anaheim Marriott Suites, on June 22, 2018, and was cancelled the same day. Over 80 creators were set to hold panels at the event including Bella Thorne, Shane Dawson, Casey Neistat, Miranda Sings, Ricky Dillon, Elijah Daniel, Jenn McAllister, Gabbie Hanna, Trevor Moran, Lisa Schwartz and Jack Baran. Despite Mongeau’s claims that 20,000 people tried to attend the convention, 4,000 to 5,000 people attended at most and the Marriott was not capable of holding even that many people. Those who attended or lined up to attend complained of lack of food and water and standing for hours in the sun. It was reported that many people were sunburned and that some people passed out because of the heat. The event had received much attention and criticism. The Verge said that fans were comparing it to Fyre Fest, and attendees were yelling “refund” after the event. Dawson said that agreeing to appear at TanaCon was the “worst decision [he] ever made”. Mongeau later apologized and said that refunds would be issued. Dawson later released a 3-part documentary style series of YouTube videos that shared Mongeau and other people involved in the convention’s perspectives on the event.</p><p>Mongeau is openly bisexual.

Although she had briefly changed her YouTube and Twitter display names to Tana Paul, her legal name is still Tana Mongeau. However, as of January 2020, she has changed her last name back to Mongeau on all social media platforms.
