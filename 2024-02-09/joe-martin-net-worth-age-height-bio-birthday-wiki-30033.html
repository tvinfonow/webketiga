Who is Joe Martin dating now & how much money does Joe Martin have?</p><h2>Joe Martin Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Joe Martin</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Celebrity</strong> who was born on <strong>November 29, 1988</strong> in Dagenham, Dagenham, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Joseph John Martin (born 29 November 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays for League Two club Northampton Town. He is a left-sided defender, who can also play as a midfielder. He represented England at under-16 and under-17 levels.</p><p>Blackpool manager Simon Grayson gave Martin his debut in the final match of the 2007–08 season, at home to Watford on 4 May 2008, a match which the Seasiders had to avoid defeat to avoid relegation to League One. Blackpool drew the match 1–1, with Martin playing on the left wing. Martin returned to Spurs at the end of the season; however, on 13 May 2008, he confirmed that he wanted to return to Blackpool for the 2008–09 season, saying, “That last game against Watford was brilliant and something I’ll remember for the rest of my life.” And adding “To make your debut in a match like that, when there was a sell-out crowd and so much riding on the outcome, was terrific. The manager seemed pretty pleased with how I did and hopefully I can come back here next year and help the club stay up, if not better. It’s up to Tottenham whether I come back. They hold all the cards. But if there is a possibility of it happening then I would love to return to Blackpool. I am really glad that Blackpool stayed up because they are a brilliant club.” Later that month Martin was linked, along with his brother, David, with a season-long loan move to Blackpool.</p><p>After playing in two League Cup games, Martin made his first league appearance of the 2009–10 season as a 46th-minute substitute in the 1–2 defeat to Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 21 November 2009. His first start in the league came on 9 January 2010, in a 1–1 draw with Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p><p>On 30 June 2010 Martin was released by Blackpool manager Ian Holloway, he then spent several months on trial at Gillingham of League Two before being signed up. He made his Gillingham debut on 11 December 2010 in a 4–2 away win over Macclesfield Town. He played for the club for over five years, being an integral part of the side that won the 2012–13 Football League Two championship, with Joe earning a place in the PFA League Two Team of the Year, but was ultimately released at the end of the 2014–15 season after being deemed surplus to requirements.</p><p align=justify>On 1 July 2008, it was confirmed that Tottenham Hotspur had accepted a bid for Martin from Blackpool and that the player was discussing personal terms. On 2 July, he signed a two-year contract with an option for a further year with Blackpool for an undisclosed fee. “[Spurs] offered me a new deal, but I wasn’t really too keen on staying there. The first-team opportunities at White Hart Lane are limited and I want to get some experience and play regularly in the first team, so it was a bit of a no-brainer for me.” Blackpool manager Simon Grayson added: “I think Joe looked at the situation and probably realised he wasn’t going to be a first-team player there and the next best thing after that is Championship football. We are delighted to have got him and he’s delighted to be here.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joe Martin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Joe</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1988</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dagenham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dagenham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>David Martin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Joe Martin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
