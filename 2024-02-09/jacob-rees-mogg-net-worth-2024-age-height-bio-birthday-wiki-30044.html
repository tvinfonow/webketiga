Rees-Mogg ascribes to this event the beginnings of his interest in stock markets. Having learned how to read company reports and balance sheets, he later attended a shareholders’ meeting at GEC, where he voted against a motion because dividends were too low. He subsequently invested in London-based&nbsp;conglomerate&nbsp;Lonrho, eventually owning 340 shares, and reportedly caused the company’s chairman Lord Duncan-Sandys “discomfort” by quizzing him at an annual general meeting on the low dividends offered to shareholders. In 1981, at a shareholders’ meeting of GEC, in which he owned 175 shares at the time, he told the chairman Lord Nelson that the dividend on offer was “pathetic”, sparking amusement among board members and the media.</p><h2>Jacob Rees-Mogg Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United Kingdom.

With an upper class background set against a predominantly working-class electorate, Rees-Mogg was criticised by many constituents for being too posh. News stories from the time ridiculed Rees-Mogg for canvassing the area with his family’s nanny and touring the constituency in a Bentley, a claim that he later described as “scurrilous”, stating it had been a Mercedes. With a name recognition of less than 2%, Rees-Mogg managed to gain the third-highest number of votes on election night, earning 9% of all votes cast, a figure much lower than that of previous Conservative Party candidates for the area. However, no new Conservative MPs were elected in Scotland that year; the Conservative Party suffered its worst electoral defeat since 1906, and lost all its seats in Scotland.</p><h2>Who is Jacob Rees-Mogg Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong> married to <strong>Helena de Chair </strong>.
