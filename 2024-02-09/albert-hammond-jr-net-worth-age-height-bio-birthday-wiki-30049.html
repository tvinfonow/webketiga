He joined The Strokes as the last member with Casablancas’ former schoolmates Nikolai Fraiture, Nick Valensi, and Fabrizio Moretti. Hammond is usually seen playing a 1985 ’70s reissue Olympic White Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul Jr. that is sometimes used by bandmate Nick Valensi. On the majority of The Strokes’ songs he plays rhythm guitar, and solos are played by Valensi. The songs in which Hammond does play solos are “Last Nite”, “Trying Your Luck”, “Take It or Leave It”, “Under Control”, “The End Has No End”, “Ize of the World”, “Threat of Joy”, “Vision of Division”, and “Drag Queen”. His solos tend to focus largely on more emotional, “bluesy”-type melodical work, and the guitar tends to have a cleaner, softer tone in comparison to Valensi’s (with a notable exception found in “Vision of Division”). He often holds his guitar in a high horizontal position, similar to Buddy Holly, which he says is so that he can dance better.</p><p align=justify>Hammond released a solo album entitled Yours To Keep in the U.K. through Rough Trade Records on October 9, 2006 and in North America through New Line Records/Scratchie Records on March 6, 2007.
