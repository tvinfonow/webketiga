Who is Eric Lewis dating now & how much money does Eric Lewis have?</p><h2>Eric Lewis Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Eric Lewis</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Jazz Musician</strong> who was born on <strong>May 13, 1973</strong> in Camden, New Jersey, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Eric Robert Lewis (born May 13, 1973), popularly known as ELEW, is an American jazz pianist who has found cross-over success playing rock and pop music. He is known for his unconventional and physical playing style, which eschews a piano bench and includes reaching inside the piano lid to pull at the strings directly, as well as the creation that he calls “Rockjazz”, a genre that “takes the improvisational aspect of jazz and ‘threads it through the eye of the needle of rock.'”</p><p>His first taste of mainstream recognition came when he played two songs, a cover of Evanescence’s “Going Under” and an original composition, as a featured speaker at the Long Beach TED Conference in 2009. While the videos of these performances on the TED Conference website and YouTube channel began to gain Lewis attention in the online world, including a write-up in The Guardian, his appearance also drew the interest of one TED conference attendee in particular: fashion designer Donna Karan, who immediately asked the pianist to compose an original piece inspired by her fall 2009 collection and play it live on the runway at her next New York City fashion show. White House Social Secretary Desiree Rogers happened to be attending the Donna Karan fashion Show at which Lewis performed, and she invited him to play in the East Room of the White House for the President and the First Lady.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Eric Lewis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Erik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ask-Upmark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jazz Musician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Camden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Eric Lewis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
