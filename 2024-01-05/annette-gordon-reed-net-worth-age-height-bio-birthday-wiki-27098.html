Who is Annette Gordon-Reed dating now & how much money does Annette Gordon-Reed have?</p><h2>Annette Gordon-Reed Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Annette Gordon-Reed</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Historian</strong> who was born on <strong>November 19, 1958</strong> in Livingston, Texas, <strong>United States</strong>. Gordon-Reed in her book argues that a large portion of the hardship caused to African Americans could have been prevented if they were granted land to cultivate their own.&nbsp;With no land to cultivate, African Americans in the Deep South generally earned livings as sharecroppers. They were primarily (if not completely) under white landowners.&nbsp;They had a limited amount of economic options or resources, and, in many cases they were compelled to follow the accounting of the owner at the close of the year.&nbsp;They frequently had to purchase items from his store that were included in the accounting.&nbsp;The situation is similar to that of workers from immigrants within their native New York garment industry (sweat shops) in the 1890s and coal miners who were held captive by mining company stores up until the UMWA was established in 1890.</p><p>The memoir about Vernon Jordan, the civil rights activist, written by him, chronicles his life from childhood until the 1980s.&nbsp;The book was awarded the award for Best Nonfiction Book for 2001 from the Black Caucus of the American Library Association.&nbsp;In 2002 , it was awarded the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and a Trailblazer Award from the Metropolitan Black Bar Association.</p><p>Gordon-Reed spent her early career as an associate at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, and as counsel to the New York City Board of Corrections. She speaks or moderates at numerous conferences across the country on history and law-related topics. She was previously Wallace Stevens Professor of Law at New York Law School (1992–2010) and Board of Governors Professor of History at Rutgers University, Newark (2007–2010).</p><p>Gordon-Reed’s study stimulated a revival of interest in this topic, and in 1998 a Y-DNA study was conducted of direct male descendants of the Jefferson male line, Eston Hemings line, and Carrs, as this DNA is passed down virtually unchanged. There was a Y-DNA match between the Jefferson male line and a male descendant of Eston Hemings. Researchers noted that, when added to the body of historical evidence, this strongly suggested Thomas Jefferson was the father of the children. In addition, the DNA analysis conclusively excluded descendants of the Carr line as a match for the Hemings descendant. Neither of the Carr nephews could have been the father of Hemings’s children. The findings received national attention, with PBS devoting a lengthy program to the issues. They have stimulated new scholarship. Major groups and historians have re-assessed their evaluation of historical evidence related to this issue.</p><p align=justify>While certain historians began reexamining Jefferson during the latter half of the twentieth century, his supporters reacted with the assumption that claims of his paternity were meant to tarnish his reputation despite the widespread recognition at the time of the many interracial relationships that Jefferson had during his period.&nbsp;The year 1974 was the first time Fawn Brodie. Brodie published one of the first biographies about Jefferson to critically examine the evidence surrounding Sally Hemings; she thought Jefferson-Hemings liaison was most likely.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Annette Gordon-Reed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Annette</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gordon-Reed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Historian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Livingston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert Reed</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Susan Reed, Gordon Reed</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Annette Gordon-Reed ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which operates Monticello, announced that its internal study had concluded that Jefferson was likely the father of Eston and all of Hemings’ children. It has since changed its exhibits, programming, academic research and other materials to reflect this. In 2001 the National Genealogical Society published a special issue on the topic; its specialists demonstrated how their review of the weight of evidence led them to conclude that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Heming’s children. The William and Mary Quarterly devoted an issue to the topic in 2001. However, there are historians who disagree; the newly formed Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society commissioned an independent report and scholars associated with it have continued to argue against the consensus. In June 2018, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation mounted a new exhibit at Monticello, The Life of Sally Hemings, which affirms that Jefferson fathered her children. This follows a major traveling exhibit in 2012 on Jefferson as a slaveholder and accounts of several major slave families at Monticello, including the Hemingses.</p><h2>Annette Gordon-Reed Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Annette Gordon-Reed is one of the <strong>richest Historian</strong> from United States.

Gordon-Reed noted that all of Sally Hemings’ children were freed. They were the only slave family to gain such freedom, which was consistent with what Madison said Jefferson had promised to his mother, Sally Hemings. Gordon-Reed concluded that Jefferson and Hemings did have a sexual relationship, though she did not try to characterize it.
