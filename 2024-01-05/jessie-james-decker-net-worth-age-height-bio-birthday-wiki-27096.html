The album was to have the same country-pop sound as her debut, with Decker being given more leeway by Mercury in incorporating country sounds. The first single, “Boys in the Summer”, released in June, was a minor country success but failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Having struggled with accepting her career path as a pop singer, Decker told her label in the midst of preparations for her album that she did not want to be a pop artist and wanted to record country music. After negotiations, Massey asked Mark Wright from Show Dog-Universal Music, which had facilitated the country release of “Boys in the Summer” in November, to help Mercury/IDJ launch Decker in the country genre. Decker began recording in April 2011. “When You Say My Name” was produced by Wright and released on January 31, 2012. “Military Man” was released on May 22, 2012. She was removed from the Show Dog Universal roster in 2013.

It was a fusion between country and pop music, with more emphasis placed on the latter as dictated by her label. The album also featured writing credits from Decker and seasoned pop songwriter Kara DioGuardi and Mitch Allan, among others. The album received mixed receptions from critics. Allmusic received the album positively, but found that despite being marketed as such and featuring some country-influenced production, the music on the album was a far cry from country music. Slant thought that the album only superficially pulled together influences from pop, country and hip-hop while failing to pander to any of those audiences. The album’s first single, “Wanted”, produced by Allan, had been released in April and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p align=justify>Decker was featured on former Hinder lead singer Austin John’s debut solo EP Love Sick Radio, on the track “Howlin'”.
