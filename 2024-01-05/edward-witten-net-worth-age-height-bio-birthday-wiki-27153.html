Who is Edward Witten dating now & how much money does Edward Witten have?</p><h2>Edward Witten Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Edward Witten</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Mathematician</strong> who was born on <strong>August 26, 1951</strong> in Baltimore, Maryland, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Edward Witten (born August 26, 1951) is an American theoretical physicist and the Charles Simonyi Professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study. Witten is a researcher in string theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetric quantum field theories, and other areas of mathematical physics. In addition to his contributions to physics, Witten’s work has significantly impacted pure mathematics. In 1990, he became the first physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, awarded for his 1981 proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity. He is considered to be the practical founder of M-theory.</p><p>Witten sits on the board of directors of Americans for Peace Now and on the advisory council of J Street. He supports the two-state solution and advocates a boycott of Israeli institutions and economic activity beyond its 1967 borders, though not of Israel itself. He is also a tennis player.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Edward Witten</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kjetil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jerve</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mathematician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baltimore</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maryland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chiara Nappi</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Daniela Witten, Ilana Witten</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Edward Witten ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In the late 1980s, Witten coined the term topological quantum field theory for a certain type of physical theory in which the expectation values of observable quantities encode information about the topology of spacetime. In particular, Witten realized that a physical theory now called Chern–Simons theory could provide a framework for understanding the mathematical theory of knots and 3-manifolds. Although Witten’s work was based on the mathematically ill-defined notion of a Feynman path integral and was therefore not mathematically rigorous, mathematicians were able to systematically develop Witten’s ideas, leading to the theory of Reshetikhin–Turaev invariants.</p><p>Another result for which Witten was awarded the Fields Medal was his proof in 1981 of the positive energy theorem in general relativity. This theorem asserts that (under appropriate assumptions) the total energy of a gravitating system is always positive and can be zero only if the geometry of spacetime is that of flat Minkowski space. It establishes Minkowski space as a stable ground state of the gravitational field. While the original proof of this result due to Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau used variational methods, Witten’s proof used ideas from supergravity theory to simplify the argument.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Edward Witten height</b> Not available right now.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Edward Witten celebrates birthday on August 26 of every year.</p><p align=justify>By the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory had developed five different consistent versions of the theory. These versions are known as type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8×E8). The thinking was that out of these five candidate theories, only one was the actual correct theory of everything, and that theory was the one whose low-energy limit matched the physics observed in our world today.</p><h3>Has Edward Witten won a Nobel Prize?</h3><p>Edward Witten He’s still alive, but <b>will probably never get the prize</b> because his theoretical work was a century or so ahead of its time.</p><h3>Why was Edward Witten important?</h3><p>He <b>made significant contributions to Morse theory, supersymmetry, and knot theory</b>.
