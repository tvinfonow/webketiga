On September 25, 1983, he made his major league debut for the Phillies. Daulton had three at bats for the Phillies in 1983. Through 1988, he played sparingly, due chiefly to the presence of all-star catchers Ozzie Virgil Jr. and Lance Parrish. Daulton became the Phillies’ full-time catcher in 1989. Throughout his early career, his primary value to the team was as a defensive catcher — his cumulative batting average of .206, through the 1988 season, was barely above the Mendoza Line — and he never appeared in as many as 60 games, in any single season. Daulton’s breakout season was 1990, his first as his team’s primary backstop; that year, he batted .268, with 57 runs batted in (RBI) — which, when coupled with his skills behind the plate, earned him a three-year contract worth $6.75 million. Daulton caught Terry Mulholland’s no-hitter, on August 15, 1990.</p><p>Following a slump, in 1991, that saw his batting average fall below .200, Daulton led the National League (NL) in RBIs, for 1992, with 109. He also finished in the top 10 in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, home runs, walks, runs created, and extra base hits. Daulton earned his first All-star appearance, the NL Silver Slugger Award, and sixth place in NL MVP voting.</p><p align=justify>He was three times married with Lynne Austin Nicole Garcia and Amanda Dick.&nbsp;He had four kids, Summer, Savannah, Zachary and Darren II.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Darren Daulton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Darren</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daulton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arkansas City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kansas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amanda Dick , Nicole Garcia , Lynne Austin</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Summer Daulton, Savannah Daulton, Darren Daulton II, Zachary Daulton</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Darren Daulton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
