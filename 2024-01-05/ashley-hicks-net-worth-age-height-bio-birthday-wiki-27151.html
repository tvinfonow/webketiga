He is the only son of Lady Pamela Hicks (née Mountbatten) and David Nightingale Hicks. Hicks designs architecture and interiors in Europe, the United States, and the United Kingdom. He divides his time between designing residential interiors and designing his fabric and furniture lines.</p><p>Hicks was raised at Britwell House, an 18th-century house in Britwell Salome, that served as the family’s home, as well as his father’s showplace. It was there that his father designed elaborate landscapes that were “virtual outdoor rooms with carefully framed vistas”. During the school year, Hicks boarded at the private, Stowe School. In 1978, the family decided to sell Britwell, their stately country house in Oxfordshire. Hicks attended the three-day Sotheby’s house sale, 20–22 March 1979. After the auction, the Hicks family moved to The Grove, a nearby estate, as well as a set of rooms at Albany, the legendary early-19th-century London apartment building in Piccadilly.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ashley Hicks</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Audrey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vandervelden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>David Nightingale Hicks, Lady Pamela Hicks</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>India Hicks</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Katalina Sharkey de Solis , Marina Allegra Federica Silvia Tondato</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ambrosia Hicks, Angelica Hicks</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ashley Hicks ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It was near Fifth Avenue, surrounded by the lofts and studios of local artists. While the building was renovated, the interior of their home was rather low scale, lacking air conditioning. Allegra said of their home, “Although it was a glamorous address it was, for us, more about the people who lived there.” They lived in New York from 1991–92. In May 2009, the couple announced the end of their marriage. Allegra remarried in June 2014 Marchese Roberto Mottola di Amato, a Neapolitan landowner and entrepreneur.</p><h2>Ashley Hicks Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ashley Hicks is one of the <strong>richest Designer</strong> from United Kingdom.

His first piece was his interpretation of a Greek Klismos chair, based on a 1920s drawing by an architect. The chair is rendered in Burmese teak, with a seat made of interwoven straps of saddle leather. He describes the chair as “far more like the ancient Greek ones in its construction, than the Neoclassical revivals”. When Hicks initially designed in India, he designed under the moniker of “Jantar Mantar”. Hicks explains, “It means abracadabra, also hocus pocus, and is local slang for the Jaipur Observatory.”</p><p>In addition to interior and furniture design, Hicks produces various lines of fabric, wallpaper, and carpeting—some under the “David Hicks by Ashley Hicks” brand and others under his own name. Licences to his fabric and wallpaper collections are held by GP & J Baker; the licences to his carpeting lines are held by Stark and Alternative Flooring. In 2002, along with his ex-wife Allegra, he wrote Design Alchemy, which provided an overview of the interiors and products they designed. Hicks also produced a series of Allegra Hicks shops as well as a collection of home accessories that were sold in these shops. In 2017, Hicks published his first book on his own work, Details, which also serves as a source book for his inspiration; published by IDEA Publishing, it sold out within a month.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ashley Hicks height</b> Not available right now.
