Who is Lil' Mo dating now & how much money does Lil' Mo have?</p><h2>Lil' Mo Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Lil' Mo</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer-Songwriter</strong> who was born on <strong>November 19, 1978</strong> in Long Island, New York, <strong>United States</strong>. Cynthia Karen Loving, born November 19, 1978, is an American R&B singer and songwriter. She is also known professionally as Lil’ Mo.&nbsp;Her single “Superwoman Pt.&nbsp;Her single “Superwoman Pt. II”, featuring the then-unknown rapper Fabolous was widely credited with launching her career.&nbsp;After being Missy Elliott’s protégé, she was first recognized for her contributions to “Hot Boyz”, her smash hit single. She also collaborated with Ja Rule on “Put It on Me” (Grammy-nominated) and “I Cry”.</p><p>In late 2001, a feud developed between Mo and Ja Rule, whose former collaborator. Murder Inc. started favoring Ashanti over Mo.&nbsp;Mo shouted at 50 Cent in January 2003 while hosting 106 & Park: Prime. This was just seconds after she had premiered a Ja Rule clip.&nbsp;Murder Inc. and Ja Rule were furious at the incident. Mo told the media that she thought BET would remove the shout and didn’t think it would cause a commotion.&nbsp;Ja Rule’s diss track, “Loose”, was released. It targeted Eminem and 50 Cent, Dr. Dre (Chris Lighty), Dr. Dre (Eminem), Chris Lighty, Chris Lighty, and Lil Mo.&nbsp;Rule claimed that she was her only hit.&nbsp;Mo released a freestyle diss track to Ja Rule in May 2003.</p><p>On June 22, 2001, while being escorted to a limousine, Lil’ Mo was assaulted by a male at a San Francisco concert venue. She was bludgeoned in the head by the man’s champagne bottle and was immediately hospitalized at California Pacific Medical Center, where she received 20 stitches. The incident traumatized Mo and left her suspicious of the attack, in which she felt it may have been a potential “set up”. Mo confirmed to MTV News that she had to cancel many shows and cease a double-music video shoot for her single “Gangsta” so she could recover from the incident. A reward ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 was issued in hopes of catching the assailant. Though the alleged male attacker was never found, local San Francisco police received anonymous tips that the attacker boasted about his actions at a Hunters Point housing project near San Francisco, California.</p><p>In April 2003, controversy arose regarding payment for Lil’ Mo’s contributions on “I Cry” and “Put It on Me”. In 2005, Lil’ Mo filed a lawsuit against Ja Rule, Murder Inc. and Def Jam for over $15&nbsp;million. In 2010, the two reconciled, and the next year, recorded a track together titled “U & Me”.</p><p align=justify>Mo released her first single, “Ta Da” on April 10, 2000.&nbsp;Mo would finally release “Superwoman Pt. 2”, her first solo hit, after years of collaborations and features that were successful.&nbsp;Her second single, “Superwoman Pt. II”, will be released on her forthcoming album.&nbsp;It was released March 6, 2001, and peaked at No.&nbsp;11, on Billboard Hot 100, which helped bring Fabolous (then an underground rapper) to mainstream attention.&nbsp;Mo’s debut album Based on a True Story, was released on June 26, 2001 to generally positive reviews.&nbsp;It peaked at No.&nbsp;The album peaked at No. 14 on Billboard 200, and received a gold certification by the RIAA. This made it Mo’s most successful album.&nbsp;Mo released the second single, “Gangsta (Love 4 the Streets),” in August 2001. However, it was not as successful as its predecessor.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lil' Mo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lil'</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer-Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Long Island</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Karl Dargan , Phillip Bryant , Gus Stone</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Heaven Love'on Stone, God'Iss Love Stone, Justin McKenzie Phillip Bryant, Jonah Maddox-Phillip Bryant</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lil' Mo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
