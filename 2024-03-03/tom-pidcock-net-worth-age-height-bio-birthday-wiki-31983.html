He is best known for winning the junior titles in the UEC European Cyclo-cross Championships at Pontchâteau, France in 2016, the UCI World Cyclo-cross Championships, at Bieles, Luxembourg in 2017 and the UCI World Time Trial Championships at Bergen, Norway in 2017.</p><p>Thereafter in November, Pidcock was able to claim victories at the Grand Prix van Hasselt, and the Bollekescross DVV Trophy event, as well as a first podium finish in the UCI Junior Cyclo-cross World Cup, with a third in Zeven, Germany. Pidcock took his first win in the competition the following month in Namur, taking the victory around the city’s citadel by almost a minute ahead of France’s Antoine Benoist; he echoed previous celebrations of Peter Sagan and Mathieu van der Poel by wheelieing across the finish line. The performances had caught the eye of Telenet–Fidea Lions team manager and former world champion Sven Nys, who was looking to sign Pidcock to his team. In the run up to the 2017 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships, Pidcock won his first British National Junior Cyclo-cross Championships title in Bradford, and won a second World Cup race in the Grand Prix Adri van der Poel at Hoogerheide, leading teammate Ben Turner home in a 1–2 finish.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom Pidcock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Toshie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tsukui</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cyclist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1999</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leeds</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tom Pidcock ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
