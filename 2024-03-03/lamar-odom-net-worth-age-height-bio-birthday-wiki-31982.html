Who is Lamar Odom dating now & how much money does Lamar Odom have?</p><h2>Lamar Odom Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Lamar Odom</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Basketball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>November 6, 1979</strong> in New York City, New York State, <strong>United States</strong>. Versatile forward who began his career with the Los Angeles Clippers and Miami Heat, then became a two-time NBA Champion with the Los Angeles Lakers and was named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.</p><p>He won two NBA titles alongside <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a> while playing with the Lakers.</p><p>Odom transferred to the University of Rhode Island, with the cost of his room and board being covered by funds his father received from the G.I. Bill. Since he was admitted as a non-matriculating student, Odom was forced to sit out the 1997–98 season. After two semesters and a summer session, however, Odom earned his eligibility to play intramural basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in some jeopardy during his first semester after he once vanished before finals; that is until coach Jim Harrick prevailed upon three of his four instructors to let him make up his extant work. The coach also had Odom work alongside DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and ended up being the player’s closest friend in college. Odom also drew inspiration from the example of his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at the age of 56.</p><p>In his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ The King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York, and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the Parade Player of the Year in 1997. Among other distinctions, he earned USA Today All-USA First Team honors and was named to the Parade All-American First Team for the second consecutive year. While still in high school, Odom played on the same AAU team as future NBA teammates Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace); he also played at the Adidas ABCD Camp with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a “$2 million smile.”</p><p align=justify>He was married to reality star <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> from 2009 to 2016. The couple had their own reality show titled Khloe and Lamar. He had three children with <a href=#>Liza Morales</a>, <a href=#>Destiny</a>, Jayden and Lamar Jr., before they separated. Jayden tragically died as an infant. In 2019, he got engaged to <a href=#>Sabrina Parr</a>.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lamar Odom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lamar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Odom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jayden Odom, Lamar Odom Jr, Destiny Odom</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lamar Odom ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
