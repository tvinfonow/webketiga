His season was cut much shorter by a four-day spell in February 1998, during which time Clemence picked up a red card against Barnsley. He involved himself to a greater degree the following season, displaying more of the form which won him a place in the England U21 side. He scored three times during his spell at Spurs, his first coming in the 1997–98 FA Cup against Fulham, followed by two league goals against Derby County and Sunderland. Despite not being part of Tottenham’s squad for the 1999 Football League Cup Final he made three appearances during their victorious League Cup campaign.</p><p>Clemence was capped by the England national under-18 team, scoring two goals in seven appearances, between 1995 and 1996. He was capped once by the under-21 team, as a substitute in a 2–0 away win over Sweden on 4 September 1998. He was eligible to play for Northern Ireland through his Northern Ireland-born grandmother. Clemence rejected the chance to represent the country in both May and July 2004, a decision which manager Lawrie Sanchez said he would respect. Sanchez did ask Clemence to reconsider in October 2006, but he never represented a national team at senior level.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen Clemence</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steven</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Seagle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Midfielder</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Liverpool</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ray Clemence</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sarah Clemence</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Angela Saunders</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephen Clemence ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
