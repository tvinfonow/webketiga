Who is Mike Papantonio dating now & how much money does Mike Papantonio have?</p><h2>Mike Papantonio Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mike Papantonio</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Lawyer</strong> who was born on <strong>October 24, 1953</strong> in New York, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Papantonio graduated from the University of Florida and received his J.D. from Cumberland School of Law. He was admitted to The Florida Bar in 1982 and the bar of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in 1983. He graduated from DeSoto County High School, Arcadia, Florida. He is a senior partner in the Pensacola, Florida-based Levin Papantonio Law Firm, a leading mass torts firm. He is noted for his success in mass torts, product liability, personal injury, and wrongful death cases, and has returned numerous verdicts of multimillion-dollar damages for his clients and his firm.</p><p>He has been listed in Best Lawyers in America since 1999, and has written several books, including the legal thriller Law and Disorder; Resurrecting Aesop: Fables Lawyers Should Remember; Clarence Darrow, the Journeyman; and In Search of Atticus Finch, A Motivational Book for Lawyers, as well as Defenses You Can Count on in an Asbestosis Case and How to Prove a Sick Building Case. He also co-authored Closing Arguments–The Last Battle with Fred Levin. Papantonio says he wrote In Search of Atticus Finch as a “wake-up call to the legal profession that has largely lost its moral compass” and has said that “seventy percent of kids coming out of law school want to represent corporations and get paid exorbitant amounts of money,” he says. “They’re willing to sell their souls to the highest bidder. We need to bring more quality to what we do as lawyers, we need to be better servants to the community and we need to have more political involvement for positive change in the country.” In 2004, Papantonio helped launch a nationwide organization called Mass Torts Made Perfect. This organization holds annual conferences for the top personal injury attorneys and teaches them successful litigation strategies to use against multi-national corporations.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Papantonio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mindy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Newell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Papantonio ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Ring of Fire airs weekly on Saturdays from 3-6 p.m. EST. On the radio show Papantonio, a Methodist, often criticizes the Christian right. He has said that “I come from a pretty strong spiritual center, but it doesn’t change the way I judge people. Simply put, the Sermon on the Mount makes much more sense to me than the frenzied rantings of America’s new ‘religious right’. They have become an element of American politics that threatens our sense of decency as well as our democracy.” His role on Ring of Fire was featured in the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp, in which he offers commentary on many of the scenes depicted. According to DVD commentary by the film’s directors, Papantonio was added to the film later on because they felt there wasn’t any “tension” in it, and they wanted another viewpoint.</p><h2>Mike Papantonio Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mike Papantonio is one of the <strong>richest Lawyer</strong> from United States.
