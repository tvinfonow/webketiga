A native of Mississauga, Ontario, Stauskas played two seasons of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition for the Michigan Wolverines ending with the 2013–14 team before declaring for the NBA draft. Stauskas was drafted eighth overall in the 2014 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings, for which he began his NBA career. Towards the end of his rookie season, Stauskas was tagged with the nickname Sauce Castillo after a closed captioning error resulted in a social media meme. Stauskas, whose family is of Lithuanian heritage, is a member of the Canadian national basketball team.</p><p>In the January 2 Big Ten Conference opener against Minnesota, Stauskas set a career high with 7 assists while scoring 14 points. On January 14, he had a game-high 21 points, team-high 5 assists as well as 6 rebounds against Penn State. On January 18, Stauskas scored 23 points including the final 11 for Michigan as the team defeated (#3) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center for the first time since the 1998–99 team did so, ending an 11-game losing streak at Wisconsin. Stauskas made all 6 of his free throw attempts in the final 25 seconds. The game marked the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road. On January 21, Stauskas earned his first Big Ten Conference Player of the Week recognition. At the time he was leading the conference in scoring and 20-point games. On January 22, against (#10) Iowa Stauskas tied his career high with 26 points and contributed 5 rebounds and 5 assists, helping Michigan defeated consecutive top 10 opponents for the first time since the 1996–97 team. On January 25 in the Michigan–Michigan rivalry game against the 2013–14 Spartans, Stauskas contributed 19 points and 4 assists, including a 5-for-6 effort on three-point shots. The 80–75 victory over (#3) Michigan State marked the first time in school history that the team defeated three consecutive AP Poll top ten opponents and marked the first time since the 1986–87 Iowa Hawkeyes that any team has won three consecutive games all of which were against top 10 opponents. It also gave Michigan a 7–0 Big Ten start, which is the best since the 1976–77 team won its first eight games. His effort for the week earned a second Big Ten Player of the Week recognition as well as a CBS Sports National Player of the Week honor on January 27. Stauskas also earned Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week recognition from United States Basketball Writers Association on January 28. He led the conference in scoring and three-point shooting percentage through January, but he only scored six points when Michigan got upset by Indiana on February 2, ending a 10-game winning streak and 8–0 Big Ten conference start. Stuaskas established another career high in assists with 8 against Nebraska on February 5 as the team posted its largest conference game margin of victory since defeating Indiana 112-64 on February 22, 1998. On February 23 against (#13/14) Michigan State, Michigan rebounded from an early 22–11 deficit to win 79–70. Stauskas led the way with 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting and with 21 coming in the second half, including 10 that took the score from a 48–43 deficit to a 53–51 lead. It marked his first game with 9 made field goals. He added 5 assists, 3 rebounds and no fouls on his way to earning his third Big Ten Player of the Week recognition on February 24. On March 4, Stauskas had 24 points, including a career-high seven three-point shots, as part of a 7-for-9 three-point effort against Illinois to help Michigan clinch its 14th and 8th outright Big Ten Conference championship. On March 8, Stauskas had a team-high 21 points to help Michigan close out its season with a season-ending 84–80 victory over Indiana. On March 10 Stauskas earned his fourth Big Ten Player of the week award (this time Co-POTW with Shavon Shields). Stauskas’s four Player of the Week awards led the Big Ten for the season.

This is somewhat confusing because various sources have various eligibility thresholds. ESPN reports leaders based on a 2 three-point attempts per game minimum, while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.5 attempts per game for eligibility. NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game, and Stauskas had been the leader since the December 9 weekly report. On January 16, Sporting News named Stauskas the surprise player of the first half of the year. As late as January 28 Stauskas was leading the Big Ten in free throw shooting percentage (.833) as well as three-pointers made and was second in 3-point shooting percentage (.490). On that day, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992. On January 31, Stauskas and Robinson were named to the Wayman Tisdale Award (USBWA National Freshman of the Year) top 12 midseason list, recognizing their performances as being among the 12 best freshman performances in the NCAA competition. Stauskas finished the 18-game 2012–13 Big Ten Conference men’s basketball season schedule with a 37% three-point percentage on 30-for-81 shooting during conference play.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Stauskas played for Canada in the 2009 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship held in Argentina.

He averaged 9.4 points per game in the tournament, including a game-high 21 points in a 126–78 loss against the United States team led by Bradley Beal and James Michael McAdoo on June 20, 2009.

Stauskas participated in strength and agility testing along with 13 shooting guards, finishing fifth in running vertical jump, sixth in standing vertical leap, seventh in the shuttle run, ninth in the three-quarter court sprint and 11th in the lane agility drill. Stauskas was drafted 8th overall by the Sacramento Kings. He is the highest Michigan selection since Jamal Crawford went 8th in the 2000 NBA draft. With teammates McGary and Robinson also being drafted, it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft. With Burke and Hardaway having been drafted the year before, every player that started in the 2013 NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship Game was drafted either in the 2013 or 2014 NBA draft.</p><p align=justify>His brother claims that Stauskas scored about 50 points a game in middle school. For much of his youth, he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos attended basketball camps together, regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took breaks from basketball for other activities. Until 2009, Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School. He averaged 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007–08 and 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008–09. Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskas’s grade 10 season in 2008–09, when Loyola was in danger of not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher. Although his father, a computer consultant, was willing to volunteer as a coach, no teacher was willing to serve. Stauskas’s father finally found a French teacher who sat in the gym and graded papers while his father coached. In the meantime, Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team in Toronto, run by Ro Russell. Some of Russell’s prior players, such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years. Stauskas, not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008–2009, spent the 2009–10 academic year at South Kent School, but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St. Mark’s School the following year. He missed the 2009–10 basketball season as a result of a hip injury. Michigan Wolverines men’s basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskas’s junior year. He visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova, Iowa State, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Florida and Providence. By the time he arrived at St. Mark’s, he was expected to be an All-State performer. In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game, Stauskas led St. Mark’s in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School, but St. Marks lost 72–56. On March 26, 2011, Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan. This commitment made him the second member of Michigan’s recruiting class of 2012. That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears men’s basketball team.</p><h2>Who is Nik Stauskas Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Nik Stauskas</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
