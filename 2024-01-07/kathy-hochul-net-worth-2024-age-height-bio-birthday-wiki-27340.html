Governor in New York since 2015.&nbsp;Prior to that, she was the U.S. Representative for New York’s 26th congressional district between the 1st of June, 2011 until January 3 2013.&nbsp;She won the special election with four candidates on the 24th of May, 2011 for the position made vacant after the departure of Republican Chris Lee, and was the first Democrat to be elected to the district in the last 40 years.</p><p>Then, in May of 2003 Erie County Clerk David Swarts was appointed by Erie County Clerk David Swarts Hochul to serve as deputy.&nbsp;In the event that Swarts was removed from office in 2007 the governor Eliot Spitzer appointed Hochul to take over the position.&nbsp;While she was appointed by Spitzer and she was against Spitzer’s idea to allow illegal immigrants to obtain an driver’s license, without presenting the social security card.&nbsp;She stated that if the proposal were to be implemented she would contact the sheriff’s office to take the applicants before a judge for questioning.&nbsp;The election was later in 2007 to serve the remaining time of Swarts’s term.&nbsp;She ran for reelection using four lines of ballots: Democratic, Conservative, Independence and Working Families Party, defeating Republican Clifton Bergfeld in November 2010 by a majority of the votes.</p><p>Hochul expressed support for the 2010 health care reform legislation passed by the 111th Congress and said during her campaign that she would not vote to repeal it.
