Who is Brett Anderson dating now & how much money does Brett Anderson have?</p><h2>Brett Anderson Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Brett Anderson</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rock Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>September 29, 1967</strong> in England, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. English frontman of the glam rock band Suede, the group that influenced alternative Britpop groups like Blur and Pulp.</p><p>He was influenced by the grunge vocal style of <a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a>.</p><p>In his teens, Anderson played guitar for garage bands such as The Pigs and Geoff, the latter featuring future Suede bassist Mat Osman. In the late 1980s, while a student at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College, London, Anderson and Osman formed Suede with Anderson’s girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, soon recruiting guitarist Bernard Butler through an advertisement in the NME. After they had received temporary percussional help from former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce, in 1991 Simon Gilbert joined as their official drummer. It was around this time that Frischmann left Anderson for Blur frontman Damon Albarn, which created an early rift in the burgeoning Britpop scene of the early 1990s. After missing too many rehearsals and flaunting her relationship with Albarn while still living with Anderson, Frischmann was fired from the group, going on to front Elastica.</p><p>Even before Suede’s first album appeared in stores, Anderson’s androgynous style and vague “confessions” about his sexuality stirred controversy in the British music press. His infamous comment that he was “a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience” was indicative of how he both courted controversy and a sexually ambiguous, alienated audience. In 1993, Suede hit number one on the UK charts. Combining Morrissey’s homoerotic posturing with David Bowie’s glam theatrics, Anderson achieved rapid fame in the UK. America, however, was still spellbound by the grunge revolution and Anderson’s grim yodellings clashed with the raw anger of Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder. Furthering complications across the Atlantic, due to a trademark dispute with the American lounge singer Suede, the band were forced to change their name to The London Suede for the American market. Although the departure of songwriting partner Butler in 1994 during the recording of second album Dog Man Star (number three on the UK charts) led many to fear Suede’s eventual demise, the band continued to release critically and increasingly commercially successful material in the UK, Europe and Asia, such as 1996’s critically acclaimed Coming Up (another number one for the band). The band went on to release Head Music (number one on the UK charts and in several countries) in 1999, but A New Morning was a commercial disappointment in 2002. In 2003, following the release of their “Singles” collection, Suede disbanded.</p><p align=justify>He married Jodi Anderson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brett Anderson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anderson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 29</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Frank Anderson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brett Anderson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was addicted for two and a half years, but stopped in late 1999, when somebody very close to him became ill. He has been clean since. Speaking of his addiction, Anderson said, “Anyone who has ever tried crack will know exactly why I took it. It’s the scariest drug in the world because the hit you get from it is so, so seductive. I wanted to experience that, and I did – repeatedly.”</p><p align=justify>Because of the huge success of the shows, a new European tour was announced for the summer of 2010 covering two festivals, Skanderborg Festival in Denmark and Parkenfestivalen in Norway.
