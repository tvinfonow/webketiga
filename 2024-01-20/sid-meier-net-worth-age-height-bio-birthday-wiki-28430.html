During this period, Meier purchased an Atari 800 circa 1981, which helped him realize that computer programming could be used to make video games. He found a co-worker, Bill Stealey, who had a similar interest in developing games, and shared the games that Meier had developed. The two decided to launch a new company for computer game development.</p><p>Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982. After a few initial 2D action games, such as Meier’s platformer Floyd of the Jungle, MicroProse settled into a run of flight simulation titles beginning with Hellcat Ace (1982) and continuing with Spitfire Ace (1982), Solo Flight (1983), and F-15 Strike Eagle (1985), all designed and programmed by Meier.</p><p align=justify>He met his wife, Susan, at church in the choir, where they sang together in the choir.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sid Meier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sid</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Meier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Game Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sarnia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>August Meier, Alberdina Meier</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Susan Meier</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ryan Meier</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sid Meier ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Meier (/ˈ m aɪər / MIRE ; born February 24, 1954) is a Canadian-American programmer, designer, and producer of several strategy video games and simulation video games, including the Civilization series. Meier co-founded MicroProse in 1982 with Bill Stealey and is the Director of Creative Development of Firaxis Games, which he co-founded with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds in 1996. For his contributions to the video game industry, Meier was inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Game Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Computer Gaming World reported in 1994 that “Sid Meier has stated on numerous occasions that he emphasizes the ‘fun parts’ of a simulation and throws out the rest”. “Meier insisted”, the magazine reported that year, “that discovering the elusive quality of fun is the toughest part of design”. According to PC Gamer, “Though his games are frequently about violent times and places, there is never any blood or gore shown. He designs and creates his games by playing them, over and over, until they are fun.”</p><p>According to Firaxis employees, Meier has been constantly developing a special game engine since around 1996 which he uses to prototype his game ideas and which he has not shared with anyone else. Dennis Shirk, a senior producer, said in 2016 that Meier would sometimes arrive at the office and announce he had a new game prototype for the company to try out and see if it could be developed further. The engine believed by Firaxis employees to be based on his original Civilization source, but expanded over the years with updates that he or other engineers will write for him.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sid Meier height</b> Not available right now.

He later explained that the inclusion of his name was because of the dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company’s earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company’s branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: “We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says ‘Bill, you should put Sid’s name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.’ And that’s how Sid’s name got on Pirates, and Civilization.”</p><p align=justify>Meier worked with a team on a dinosaur-themed game starting in early 2000, but announced in an online development diary in 2001 that the game had been shelved. Despite trying various approaches, including turn-based and real-time gameplay, he said he found no way to make the concept fun enough. In 2005, he said, “We’ve been nonstop busy making other games over the past several years, so the dinosaur game remains on the shelf. However, I do love the idea of a dinosaur game and would like to revisit it when I have some time.”</p><h2>Who is Sid Meier Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sid Meier</strong> married to <strong>Susan Meier</strong>.

Meier eventually left MicroProse and in 1996 founded Firaxis Games along with veteran designer and gaming executive Jeff Briggs. The company makes strategy games, many of which are follow-ups to Meier’s titles, such as the new Civilization games and Sid Meier’s Pirates! (2004). In 1996, he invented a “System for Real-Time Music Composition and Synthesis” used in C.P.U. Bach. Next Generation listed him in their “75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995”, calling him “a prolific developer of some of the best games in [MicroProse]’s catalog.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Sid Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Game Designer</strong>.
