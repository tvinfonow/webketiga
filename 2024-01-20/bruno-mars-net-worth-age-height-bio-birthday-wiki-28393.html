You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It’s just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I’m a fan.</p><p>Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family which exposed him to a diverse mix of music genres, including reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&B. His mother was both a singer and a dancer, and his father performed Little Richard rock and roll music. Mars’ uncle was an Elvis impersonator, and also encouraged three-year-old Mars to perform on stage. Mars performed songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. At the age of four, Mars began performing five days a week with his family’s band, The Love Notes, and became known in Hawaii for his impersonation of Elvis Presley. When he was five he peed himself during a performance of Elvis’ “Can’t Help Falling in Love” (1961), which led his parents to think they could be making a mistake. However, Mars never waivered. In 1990, Mars was featured in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as “Little Elvis” and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.</p><p align=justify>His parents were Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot.

Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a “truly global star”. Boston Herald’ s Jim Sullivan compared Mars’ shownmaship to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a “consummate performer.” The Boston Globe’s Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an “indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing” and “classic showmanship.” In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News stated of the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars “brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance.” The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger. Nowadays, before the shows, he watches Brown’s T.A.M.I. Show, James Hendrix’s Live at Woodstock or Prince performing “Purple Rain” (1984).</p><p align=justify>After Mars’ sister in Los Angeles, California played his demo for Mike Lynn, (the head of A&R at Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment record label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. At that time, he lived on Mansfield and remembers trying to park his car and finding the parking space with a homeless guy, “taking a shit”, with “no toilet paper, nothing! It was just foul, and no one cleaned it up.” He adopted his stage name from the childhood nickname his father gave him, adding “Mars” at the end because: “I felt like I didn’t have [any] pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I’m out of this world, so I was like I guess I’m from Mars.” Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also an effort to “avoid being stereotyped”, as the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist. They even tried to convince Mars to sing in Spanish.</p><h2>Who is Bruno Mars Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bruno Mars</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
