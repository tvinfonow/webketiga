Marc Forster is set to direct, with Brown writing the screenplay. Brown told Entertainment Weekly that after completing the original trilogy, “I took a meager little break, mostly to stretch my screenwriting muscles.” As of February 2016, the film was still in development, with Brown having written the first two drafts. He said in March 2016, “I have written the first two drafts of the film and now we’re on the third. Hopefully it will be greenlit this year. The vision from the film makers is ‘ Lawrence of Arabia in space’, which is terribly exciting for me as it’s my favorite film.” The rights eventually reverted back to Brown, and in January 2018 he said he was developing Red Rising as a television series. Brown confirmed in October 2018 that the project had a director and a showrunner, and added that the film rights had also been resold to an unspecified studio.</p><h2>Who is Pierce Brown Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Pierce Brown</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

I just wrote it down on a piece of paper just to be crazy, and people loving that is so strange.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Pierce Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Novelist</strong>.
