However, Gostkowski, who also scored two field goals during the game, was defended by Patriots coach Bill Belichick and teammates Julian Edelman, Logan Ryan, Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, Danny Amendola, and Malcolm Butler. It was also his first miss in 56 attempts since the NFL moved the spot for extra points from the 2-yard line back to the 15-yard line.</p><h2>Who is Stephen Gostkowski Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Stephen Gostkowski</strong> married to <strong>Hallie Gostkowski (m. 2008)</strong>.
