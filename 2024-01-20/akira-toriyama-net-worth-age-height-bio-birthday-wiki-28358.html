Who is Akira Toriyama dating now & how much money does Akira Toriyama have?</p><h2>Akira Toriyama Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Akira Toriyama</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Illustrator</strong> who was born on <strong>April 5, 1955</strong> in Nagoya, <strong>Japan</strong>. Manga and game artist best known for his work the manga series “Dr. Slump” from 1980 until 1984 and “Dragon Ball” from 1984 until 1995. His work on “Dr. Slump” earned him the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award.</p><p>He and fellow Japanese artist <a href=#>Masashi Kishimoto</a> both rose to fame through their manga art.</p><p>Before becoming a manga artist, he worked at an advertising agency in Nagoya designing posters for three years. After quitting his previous job, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in a Jump magazine in order to win the prize money. While it did not win, Kazuhiko Torishima, who would later become his editor, contacted him and gave him encouragement. His debut came later in 1978 with the story Wonder Island, which was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump. However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series Dr. Slump, which was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1980 to 1984. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot Arale. He began the series at age 25 while living at home with his parents, but when the series ended in 1984 he was a “manga superstar”. In 1981, Dr. Slump earned him the Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen or shōjo manga series of the year. A very successful anime adaptation aired on TV from 1981 to 1986, with a remake series airing from 1997 to 1999. By 2008, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in Japan.</p><p>Manga critic Jason Thompson declared Toriyama’s art influential, saying that his “extremely personal and recognizable style” was a reason for Dragon Ball’s popularity. He points out that the popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had “manly” heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series’ most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that Dragon Ball is “an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist.” However, James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually “lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity.”</p><p align=justify>He and his wife, Nachi Mikami, have two children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Akira Toriyama</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Akira</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Toriyama</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illustrator</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nagoya</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nachi Mikami</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sasuke Toriyama</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Akira Toriyama ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Akira Toriyama</b>'s net worth <strong>$45 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He won an amateur manga competition sponsored by Jump magazine and went on to publish his first professional work in 1978.

He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illustrator</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Toriyama’s official fan club Akira Toriyama Hozonkai (鳥山明保存会 , “Akira Toriyama Preservation Society”) was established in 1982. Its newsletters were called Bird Land Press and were sent to members until the club closed in 1987.</p><p>In 1984, Weekly Shōnen Jump began serializing Toriyama’s Dragon Ball, which became an instant hit. As of 2014, it had sold 159.5 million tankōbon copies in Japan alone, making it Shueisha’s second best-selling manga of all time. It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the “most influential shōnen manga.” Dragon Ball was one of the main reasons for the magazine’s circulation hitting a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995). The series’ success encouraged Toriyama to continue working on it from 1984 to 1995. At the series’ end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could “take some new steps in life.” During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to five anime adaptations, several animated movies, numerous video games, and mega-merchandising. The third anime adaptation, Dragon Ball GT, was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in coming up with the name and designing the main cast. Aside from its popularity in Japan, Dragon Ball was successful internationally as well, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with 250–300 million copies of the manga sold worldwide.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Akira Toriyama height</b> Not available right now.

It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the second best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball’ s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime’s popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.</p><p align=justify>While Toriyama was serializing Dragon Ball weekly, Torishima recruited him to work as character designer for the 1986 role-playing video game Dragon Quest. The artist admitted he was pulled into it without even knowing what an RPG was and that it made his already busy schedule even more hectic, but he was happy to have been a part after enjoying the finished game. Toriyama has continued to work on every installment in the Dragon Quest series. He has also served as the character designer for the Super Famicom RPG Chrono Trigger and for the fighting games Tobal No. 1 and Tobal 2 for the PlayStation.</p><h2>Who is Akira Toriyama Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong> married to <strong>Nachi Mikami </strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Akira Toriyama!<p>Toriyama was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, as long as they have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games’ packaging art and, for Dragon Quest VIII, the boats and ships. In 2016, Toriyama revealed that because of the series’ established time period and setting, his artistic options are limited, which makes every iteration harder to design for than the last. The series’ Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.</p><h2>Top Facts about Akira Toriyama</h2><li>Akira Toriyama is a Japanese manga artist and character designer.</li><li>He was born on April 5, 1955 in Nagoya, Japan.</li><li>Toriyama’s most famous work is the Dragon Ball series.</li><li>He has also created other popular manga such as Dr. Slump and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman.</li><li>Toriyama has won numerous awards for his work including the Shogakukan Manga Award and the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize.</li><li>His art style is known for its distinctive characters and humor.</li><li>Toriyama has influenced many other manga artists around the world.</li><li>He enjoys collecting antique cars and playing video games in his free time.</li><li>The Dragon Ball franchise has sold over 300 million copies worldwide.</li><li>Toriyama continues to be involved in new Dragon Ball projects today, including writing for the anime series Super Dragon Ball Heroes.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Akira Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Illustrator</strong>.
