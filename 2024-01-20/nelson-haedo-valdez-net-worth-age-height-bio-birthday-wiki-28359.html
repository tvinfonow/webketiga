Who is Nelson Haedo Valdez dating now & how much money does Nelson Haedo Valdez have?</p><h2>Nelson Haedo Valdez Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Nelson Haedo Valdez</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Soccer Player</strong> who was born on <strong>November 28, 1983</strong> in Paraguay, <strong>Paraguay</strong>. Paraguayan soccer player who’s best known for playing for Borussia Dortmund, the Seattle Sounders, Eintracht Frankfurt, and the Paraguay national team.</p><p>Both he and <a href=#>Roque Santa Cruz</a> played for the Paraguay national team.</p><p>Aged 15, Haedo Valdez left his home and family to move to Ypané when he joined the Youth Academy of Atlético Tembetary, and eventually made his first-team debut in the Paraguayan División Intermedia in 2000. The second division club were not able to pay him a salary large enough to earn a living and his family were not able to provide funding for him. Valdez confessed the difficulty he faced when leaving his impoverished family and his home to begin playing with the club, for two years he lived under the wooden plank grandstands of the stadium in a stairwell, using a makeshift bed of blankets and cardboard which laid in the stairwell beneath the stand. He never told his parents, who were poor land workers. Valdez stated, “For two years I lived under the grandstands, we were 12 or 13 people and some of them only endured two or three weeks.” While living 250 kilometres away from his family, Valdez had no home while playing for Tembetary. He worked night shifts in a sawmill to pay for food and drink. He was a 16-year-old exposed to danger and the Paraguayan climate, boiling hot summers and freezing cold winters, which Valdez described as “hell, frightening and horrible. But if you have nothing, what can they steal? I had nothing to give”. Jürgen Born, chairman of the board or management of German Bundesliga club Werder Bremen and who worked for Deutsche Bank in Latin America, stated that he saw a “madman who never stopped running”, remembering youth games in Ypané. He bought Valdez a ticket to Germany and got on the phone to Werder Bremen. In December 2001, Valdez flew over to Germany for a trial. Valdez failed at first, not impressing in his trial but the club president’s wife, who was a fellow Paraguayan, asked for Valdez to be given another trial. He scored four times in his first trial match and was offered a contract to join Werder Bremen II, the club’s Regionalliga Nord team.</p><p>Upon joining Werder Bremen in December 2001, Haedo Valdez did not know a word of German and knew just enough Spanish due to being much more fluent in Guaraní. Valdez stated that his first months were very hard because of the cold weather and that he did not know how to order food properly. For the first few months, he did not eat anything except chicken and chips because he would see it through the glass at a restaurant.</p><p align=justify>His parents are Silvia and Antonio Haedo. He married his wife Martynka in 2008. The couple has a daughter, Tynka Noemi Beatha and a son, Nelson Samuel.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nelson Haedo Valdez</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nelson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Valdez</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paraguay</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paraguay</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Silvia Haedo, Antonio Haedo</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Martynka Haedo Valdez</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tynka Noemi Beatha Haedo, Nelson Samuel Haedo</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nelson Haedo Valdez ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
