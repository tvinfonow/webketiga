Glenn Dee Hubbard (born September 25, 1957) is a former first base coach for the Atlanta Braves and second baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played from 1978 to 1989. Hubbard played his first ten seasons with the Atlanta Braves and his last two with the Oakland Athletics.</p><p>Hubbard’s most notable trading card is the 1984 Fleer version in which he has an eight-foot boa constrictor draped around his neck.</p><p>The Kansas City Royals organization hired Hubbard in 2011. As of the 2015 season Hubbard is now bench coach for the Lexington Legends who operate as the Royals class A team. On June 24, 2016, the Legends held a promotional giveaway with a Glenn Hubbard bobblehead featuring him in a Legends uniform with a boa constrictor draped across his neck, an image made popular by his 1984 Fleer baseball card.</p><p align=justify>In 1983, Hubbard had his best season; he hit .263 with 14 home runs and 70 RBI as he earned his only All-Star Game appearance. During his 7th inning at-bat, announcers Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola made numerous light-hearted comments about his full beard, as beards were not in fashion at the time. Hubbard got a single when he hit a hard grounder to another first-time All-Star, Cal Ripken. The ball took a wicked hop that Ripken couldn’t handle.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glenn Hubbard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glenn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glenn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hahn Air Base</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hahn Air Base</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gregg Hubbard</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Constance Pond Hubbard (m. 1989), Constance Pond Hubbard</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Glenn Hubbard ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
