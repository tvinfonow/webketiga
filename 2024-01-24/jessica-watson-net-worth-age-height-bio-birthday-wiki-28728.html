Explorer, who became one of the youngest people to travel unaided across the globe and not stop until May 2010.&nbsp;The trip covered 21,600 nautical miles from October 2009 until May 2010.</p><p>She was able to circumnavigate the globe, much like&nbsp;She successfully circumnavigated the globe like <a href=#>Ferdinand Magellan</a>, who was the first person to do so.&nbsp;and was also the very first to complete the feat.</p><p>Jessica Watson OAM (born 18 May 1993) is an Australian sailor who was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for completing a southern hemisphere solo circumnavigation at the age of 16. Departing Sydney on 18 October 2009, Watson headed north-east, crossing the equator in the Pacific Ocean before crossing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. She returned to Sydney on 15&nbsp;May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday, though the voyage was ultimately shorter than the required 21,600 nautical miles to be considered a global circumnavigation. In recognition of her achievement Watson was named the 2011 Young Australian of the Year, and the following year was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. She currently resides in Buderim, Queensland.</p><p>Watson had been planning to complete a solo non-stop and unassisted circumnavigation since at least early 2008. Officially announced in May 2009, the journey was expected to take eight months with an estimated distance of 23,000 nautical miles. To fulfill the plan of sailing non-stop and unassisted, during the journey no other person would be allowed to give her anything and she must not moor to any port or other boat, although advice over radio communication would be permitted.</p><p align=justify>Their parents were New Zealanders Roger as well as Julie Watson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica Watson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jessica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Watson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Explorer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1993</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gold Coast</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Queensland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Australia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Julie Watson, Roger Watson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hannah Watson, Emily Watson, Tom Watson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jessica Watson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jessica Watson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was a family member aboard a cruiser that was a cabin for five years. In addition, she stayed in an oversized double-decker bus.</p><p align=justify>Some have criticized her due to her voyage not meeting the official World Sailing Speed Record Council requirements.</p><p align=justify>Watson was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The second of four children of New Zealander couple Roger and Julie Watson, who moved to Australia in 1987, she has dual Australian and New Zealand citizenship. She has an older sister (Emily) and younger brother and sister (Tom and Hannah). All four took sailing lessons as children, and the family went on to live on board a 16-metre cabin cruiser for five years, the children being home schooled via distance learning. Later they lived on a purpose-built double decker bus for some time. When Watson was eleven and they were still living on the boat, her mother read Jesse Martin’s book Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit to the children as a bedtime story. This led to Watson forming the ambition, at age 12, to sail around the world too.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Explorer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During a test run sailing from Brisbane to Sydney, on her first night after leaving Brisbane, Ella’s Pink Lady collided with the Silver Yang, a 63,000-tonne bulk carrier at about 02.00&nbsp;am on 9 September 2009 near Point Lookout. Watson’s boat was dismasted in the collision. She was able to retain control and return the boat to Southport under motor.</p><p>Watson was named the Australian Geographic Society’s Young Adventurer of the Year in 2010. She was selected as one of the ten international “2010 Adventurers of the Year” by National Geographic Society, and was the only sailor in the group.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jessica Watson height</b> Not available right now.

Then she crossed the equator again at 156°20’W longitude, and continued south-easterly towards Cape Horn. The sailed distance from Sydney to Kiritimati was about 3,900 nmi. At Christmas she was near Point Nemo, the place located furthest from land.</p><p align=justify>Sailing website Sail-World.com published an analysis on 3 May 2010 which claimed that the expected rhumb line distance travelled by Watson was 19,631.6&nbsp;nmi (36,357.7&nbsp;km), which was less than the required distance according to the definition set by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC), and that the journey was therefore ineligible to claim world record status for round-the-world journeys. The equivalent orthodromic distance for Watson’s route would be 18,582&nbsp;nmi (34,414&nbsp;km). The WSSRC definition states in part “The shortest orthodromic track of the vessel must be at least 21,600&nbsp;nmi (40,000&nbsp;km) in length.” The analysis suggests that Watson’s published distance logs are based on sailed distances, including tacks and strategic weather detours, rather than the shortest orthodromic track between islands and capes as defined. The rule is based on the older rule, followed by current record-holder Jesse Martin, that during a circumnavigation the sailor must pass two points on opposite sides of the earth (antipodes). For example, if starting in southern England, a place near the start will be opposite to the track near New Zealand. It was replaced by the rule that for world records the shortest orthodromic track must be at least as long as the circumference of the earth (hence 21,600 nautical miles).</p><h2>Who is Jessica Watson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jessica Watson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
