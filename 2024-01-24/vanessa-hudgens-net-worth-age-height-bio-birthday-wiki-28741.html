Schall claims Hudgens owed him $150,000 after helping her earn more than $5 million for her music career. Hudgens argued that she was a 16-year-old minor when she signed the contract in October 2005, and therefore too young to do so. She subsequently disaffirmed it on October 9, 2008. Papers filed in court by her lawyer say California’s Family Code “provides that the contract of a minor is voidable and may be disaffirmed before (age&nbsp;18) or within a reasonable time afterward.” In 2008, Hudgens was sued by Johnny Vieira, who claims he was owed a share of Hudgens’ advances, royalties and merchandising revenue in exchange for his management services. Vieira accuses Hudgens of abandoning her talent team as soon as she became a commercial name. In early May 2009, the case was settled.</p><h2>Top Facts about Vanessa Hudgens</h2><li>Vanessa Hudgens was born on December 14, 1988.</li><li>She rose to fame with her role in High School Musical.</li><li>Hudgens has released two studio albums as a singer.</li><li>Her net worth is estimated at $16 million.</li><li>She has over 40 million followers on Instagram.</li><li>Hudgens has starred in several successful films and TV shows.</li><li>She won the Teen Choice Award for Breakout Female Star in 2006.</li><li>Hudgens has also appeared on Broadway in Gigi (2015).</li><li>She dated co-star Zac Efron from High School Musical (2005-2010).</li><li>Hudgens is of mixed Filipino, Chinese, Irish, and Native American descent.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Vanessa Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Pop Singer</strong>.
