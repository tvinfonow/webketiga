Quarterback known more for his speed and open-field running than his passing who debuted for the Ohio State Buckeyes in 2011. He was switched to wide receiver in 2015 and was a third-round pick of the Houston Texans in 2016.</p><p>He and fellow Buckeye alum <a href=#>Terrelle Pryor</a> both starred at quarterback at OSU before eventually becoming wide receivers in the NFL.</p><p>Miller committed to Ohio State on June 3, 2010 under then-head coach Jim Tressel. Miller also had scholarship offers from Alabama, Cincinnati, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Southern California, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It was rumored that Miller’s friendship with another five-star recruit from Springfield, Ohio, Trey DePriest, would result in DePreist attending Ohio State as well. Instead, DePreist chose to attend Alabama.</p><p>Miller began the 2011 season as the backup to Joe Bauserman, but saw action in the season opening game against Akron, where he completed 8 of 12 passes for 130 yards and a touchdown in the 42–0 victory. Miller did not play in the second game of the season, a 27–22 victory over Toledo, due to a coaching decision, by interim head coach Luke Fickell. Miller played very little in the third game of the season, a 24–6 loss to the Miami Hurricanes. Miller was named the starting quarterback for the Buckeyes’ fourth game against Colorado. His first career start turned out to be the best performance of his young career, as he tossed two touchdown passes, while going just 5 for 13 for 83 yards in the game. He was also able to run for 83 yards in the 37–17 victory. His second career start proved to not be so successful, as the Buckeyes lost 7–10 against Michigan State. For the game, Miller completed only 5 of 10 passes for 56 yards with an interception. He also was sacked several times resulting in −27 yards rushing. In his third career start against Nebraska, Miller completed 5 of 9 passes for 95 yards and a touchdown, before leaving the game with an ankle injury in the 3rd quarter. The Buckeyes had built a 27–6 lead with Miller playing, but they went on to lose the game 34–27, with Bauserman leading the offense for the rest of the game.</p><p align=justify>He was born to Kevin and Kelly Miller.
