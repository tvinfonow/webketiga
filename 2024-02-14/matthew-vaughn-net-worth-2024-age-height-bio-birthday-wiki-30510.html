A paternity investigation in the 1980s revealed that Robert Vaughn was not his father, but Ceaton never revealed otherwise to Vaughn. Upon asking his mother about his true paternity, she revealed that his father was George Albert Harley de Vere Drummond, an English aristocrat who is a godson of King George VI.
