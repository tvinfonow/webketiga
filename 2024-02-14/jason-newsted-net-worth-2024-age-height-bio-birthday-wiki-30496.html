Following Burton’s death, the group began a search for a new bassist. They considered and auditioned over 50 musicians, including Greg Christian of Testament, Gene Gilfen of Blind Illusion, Mel Sanchez of Abbatoir, Mike Jastremski of Heathen, Troy Gregory, Les Claypool, David Ellefson of Megadeth and various others. Newsted was the last in line and ended up winning the part. He said in a 2015 interview that he learned about Metallica’s plan to open for Ozzy Osbourne’s tour at the time. To his advantage, Newsted strategically procured the band’s setlist, studied it, and presented it to drummer Lars Ulrich saying he knew all these songs, much to Ulrich’s surprise. Two days later, Metallica invited Newsted back and announced to him that he had been chosen to fill the bassist position. The band involved both of Burton’s parents in the decision to choose Newsted as the group’s new bassist and, in ceremonious fashion, Burton’s parents were present during the announcement so they would know who would be carrying on their son’s legacy and to “pass Cliff’s torch on.” In a highly emotional moment, after the band broke the news to Newsted, Burton’s mother hugged him tightly and said, “You are the one. Please, be safe.”</p><h2>Jason Newsted Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jason Newsted is one of the <strong>richest Bassist</strong> from United States.

His studio debut with Metallica was on The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited in 1987. This was followed by his first studio album with the band, …And Justice for All (1988), which was subject to controversy and criticism for, among other issues, its murky bass sound. Newsted claims this was further hazing on the part of Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield, although both Ulrich and Hetfield claim they were also disappointed with the production of the album. In addition, they claim that most or all of Newsted’s bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines to the point of being indiscernible from each other. However, Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the poor sound quality of the record. Nonetheless, the album peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 and projected the band to higher success.</p><p align=justify>These basses remained in his rig until August 1989, where on the “Binge and Purge” DVD Seattle show he was using Alembic basses.</p><h2>Who is Jason Newsted Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jason Newsted</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
