Peter L. Warrick (born June 19, 1977) is an American former college and professional football player who was a wide receiver in National Football League (NFL) for six seasons. He played college football at Florida State University, and was recognized a consensus All-American twice. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals fourth overall in the 2000 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Bengals and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL, and the Bloomington Extreme of the Indoor Football League (IFL).</p><p>1999: NCAA Consensus All-American Walter Camp Football Foundation – First-team All-American Football Writers Association of America – First-team All-American Football News – First-team All-American The Sporting News – First-team All-American Associated Press – First-team All-American All-American Foundation – First-team All-American American Football Coaches Association – First-team All-American First-team All-ACC</p><p>Warrick missed most of the 2004 season with an injury, and receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh, a 7th round pick in the 2001 draft, replaced him at the #2 receiver spot and ended up having the best season of his career. Warrick was released from the Bengals before the start of the 2005 season.</p><p>On September 2, 2006, Warrick was cut from the Seahawks after the preseason. The New York Giants worked him out on November 13, as did the Bengals later in the year, but both teams opted to pass on him as well.</p><p align=justify>On September 29, 1999, during Warrick’s senior season at Florida State, Warrick and teammate Laveranues Coles went to Dillard’s in the Tallahassee Mall and bought $412.38 worth of clothing for $21.40—a discount so large that it is considered shoplifting under Florida law. An off-duty officer saw what happened through a surveillance camera. Warrick, Coles and the clerk, Rachel Myrtil, were arrested for grand theft. On October 22, Warrick pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty theft in connection with the department store scam. At that year’s rivalry game between the Florida Gators and Florida State, Gators fans brought Dillard’s bags to Florida Field in order to mock Warrick. Florida State won the game, 30 to 23.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peter Warrick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bradenton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bradenton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Peter Warrick ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
