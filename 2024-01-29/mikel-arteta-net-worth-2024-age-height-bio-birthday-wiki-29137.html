After six seasons at Everton, he joined Arsenal as a midfielder in 2011. He helped Rangers FC win the Scottish Premier League title, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup.</p><p>In 2011, he joined the Arsenal captain&nbsp;He joined captain <a href=#>Thomas Vermaelen</a> on Arsenal in 2011..</p><p>Arteta played for Spain at youth level. He played in the victorious 1999 UEFA European Under-16 Championship campaign, at the 1999 UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup, 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and captained the side in the 2004 U21 European Championships qualifying campaign. In 2010, there were moves by the English FA and Fabio Capello to see if Arteta could represent England, believing he qualified under FIFA’s five-year residency rule. FIFA ruled this out, however, with Arteta claiming in an interview in 2016 that he “almost went to war with FIFA” over the ruling.</p><p>Born in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Arteta began his football career at Antiguoko and befriended fellow midfielder Xabi Alonso as they played together every weekend. The two often played along the beaches and gutters of San Sebastián and dreamed of playing together at Real Sociedad. Arteta left for the FC Barcelona B squad at 15 years of age while Alonso signed for Real Sociedad later. Despite his potential Arteta failed to break into the first team, and went out on loan to French club Paris Saint-Germain in December 2000. During a season and a half in Paris, Arteta was used by manager Luis Fernandez primarily as a playmaker. He made his first appearances in the UEFA Champions League in the 2000–01 second group stage. PSG wanted to keep Arteta at the end of the loan period, and did have a ‘buy first’ option. However Arteta was signed by Rangers in March 2002, after the Scottish club made a more financially impressive offer to Barcelona, although he remained with PSG until the end of the 2001–02 season.</p><p align=justify>With his wife&nbsp;Lorena, he had two children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mikel Arteta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mikel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arteta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1982</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Sebastián</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basque Country</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Spain</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lorena Bernal</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gabriel Arteta Bernal, Daniel Arteta Bernal, Oliver Arteta Bernal</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mikel Arteta ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He enjoyed a successful first season in Glasgow and quickly established himself as a first-team regular. Highlights were scoring on his Old Firm debut, and converting a late penalty on the final day of the 2002–03 season, which proved vital for goal difference as Rangers completed the domestic treble of the Scottish Premier League title, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup (Arteta was injured shortly before the 2003 Scottish Cup Final and missed the match).</p><h2>Mikel Arteta Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mikel Arteta is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from Spain.

However, Alonso left for Liverpool and Arteta failed to establish himself in the team, starting only three league matches in the half-season he spent back in San Sebastián.</p><p>The 2005–06 season saw Arteta pick up both the Everton Fans’ Player of the Season and the Players’ Player of the Season awards. Arteta’s good form extended into 2006–07. As well as retaining his starting place, he frequently turned in man-of-the-match displays, and finished the season with nine goals from the 35 league games he played. Arteta was awarded the Player of the Season Award for the second consecutive year. He was also voted the Premier League’s ‘Midfielder of the Year’ by the viewers of Sky Sports, beating PFA Players’ Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mikel Arteta height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Mikel <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Born in San Sebastián, Arteta played as an attacking and defensive midfielder, and operated primarily as a playmaker. He was a youth player at Barcelona, but never featured for the first team, and made his senior debut as a loanee in Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain in 2001. He signed for Scottish club Rangers in 2002, and won the domestic double of the Premier League and League Cup in his debut season. Following a brief stint with Real Sociedad, Arteta joined Everton on loan in 2005; he then signed permanently. He moved to Arsenal in 2011, where he won two FA Cups and served as captain from 2014, until his retirement in 2016.</p><p align=justify>While initially thought of as a “pivot” or defensive midfielder in the mould of Pep Guardiola, it was only since being moved to a more attacking role, first by Luis Fernandez at PSG, that Arteta truly began to flourish. He was rated as the sixth most effective player in the Premier League in 2006–07 by the official player ratings system the Actim Index. Arteta returned to his original deeper midfield role at Arsenal. His total of 12 league assists in the 2006–07 season was third to Cesc Fàbregas and Cristiano Ronaldo. With 100 fouls committed against him in the same season, he was the most fouled player in the Premier League.</p><h2>Who is Mikel Arteta Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mikel Arteta</strong> married to <strong>Lorena Bernal </strong>.
