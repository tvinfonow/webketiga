The issue was heightened after Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared in the video of “Say My Name”, implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced. Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months, as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the departure. After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded “Independent Women Part I”, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie’s Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks. The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame. Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.</p><h2>Kelly Rowland Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kelly Rowland is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

When she was six, her mother left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic due to PTSD from Vietnam, and Rowland went with her. At the age of eight, she relocated to Houston. In 1992, Rowland joined a girl group, originally named Girl’s Tyme. Rowland’s addition made it a six-member group. West coast R&B producer, Arne Frager, flew to Houston to see them and eventually brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studio, in Northern California. As part of efforts to sign Girl’s Tyme to a major label record deal, Frager’s strategy was to debut them on Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at that time. They participated but lost the competition to Skeleton Crew.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rowland branched out into acting with a guest stint on the sitcom The Hughleys in 2002, before appearing in other UPN shows such as Eve and Girlfriends in the years of 2003 and 2006 respectively. Having played the role of Tammy Hamilton, an ambitious 21-year-old apprentice to realtor Toni (Jill Marie Jones) in the latter sitcom, Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW network the following year plans for a return eventually went nowhere. Also, in 2003, she appeared in American Dreams as Martha Reeves of Martha & The Vandellas, singing a version of the group’s single “Nowhere to Run”.</p><p>Most of the lyrical themes in Simply Deep (2002) speak of love and life experiences, particularly in the songs “Dilemma”, in which Rowland expresses her endless love to her love interest, and “Stole”, in which she sings about an emotional “tale of school shootings and suicides”. In Ms. Kelly (2007), Rowland covers topics such as her “deeply personal relationship issues” in her songs, “Still in Love with My Ex”, “Flashback”, “Love”, “Better Without You” and “Gotsta Go (Part I)”. Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the songs could be about Rowland’s former relationship with American football player Roy Williams. Here I Am (2011) included common themes of womanhood, sexual intimacy, and love. Some of Rowland’s other songs such as “Work”, “I’m Dat Chick” and “Work It Man” have been musically compared to the work of former Destiny’s Child bandmate Beyoncé.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kelly Rowland height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Kelly <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1995, Rowland moved in with fellow Destiny’s Child member and best friend Beyoncé Knowles’ family. Not long after the inclusion of Rowland, Beyoncé’s father, Mathew, cut the original lineup from six to four with LeToya Luckett joining in 1993. The group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B groups of the time, such as SWV, Dru Hill, and Immature. They auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, only to be dropped months later before they could release an album.</p><p align=justify>Rowland’s debut solo album, Simply Deep, was released on October 22, 2002, in the US. Featuring production contributions by Mark J. Feist, Big Bert, Rich Harrison, and singers Brandy and Solange Knowles providing background vocals, the album took Rowland’s solo work further into an alternative music mixture, which Rowland described as a “weird fusion [of] a little bit of Sade and a little bit of rock.” Simply Deep debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and at number three on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 77,000 copies sold. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2013, Simply Deep remains as Rowland’s best-selling album in the US, with 602,000 copies sold. Released to an even bigger success in international territories, Simply Deep topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, resulting in worldwide sales total of 2.5 million copies.

Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums, she struggled to find her sound. “I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching, and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [and management] wanted me to try it, and I did it&nbsp;…&nbsp;And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007.” Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R&B sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated that part of the reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying “I knew I couldn’t be afraid of this direction, and I wasn’t going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction”.</p><h2>Top Facts about Kelly Rowland</h2><li>Kelly Rowland is a Grammy-winning American singer and actress.</li><li>She was born on February 11, 1981 in Atlanta, Georgia.</li><li>Rowland rose to fame as a member of Destiny’s Child.</li><li>She has released four solo albums since leaving the group.</li><li>Rowland has sold over 30 million records worldwide.</li><li>In addition to music, she has acted in films and TV shows.</li><li>Rowland is also an author and fashion designer.</li><li>She has been a judge on several talent competition shows.</li><li>Rowland is married with two children.</li><li>Her net worth is estimated at $20 million USD.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Kelly Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Pop Singer</strong>.
