Jefferson H. Van Drew (born February 23, 1953) is an American dentist and politician, serving as the U.S. Representative for New Jersey’s 2nd congressional district since 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party after leaving the Democratic Party in 2020 due to their support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. He served as the New Jersey State Senator from the 1st Legislative District from 2008 to 2018. He represented the same district in the New Jersey General Assembly from 2002 to 2008.</p><p>During his congressional primary campaign, Van Drew had a 100% rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). In 2007 and 2008, Van Drew received $2,700 from the National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc., and in 2008, Van Drew received $1,000 from the NRA. In 2010, Van Drew sponsored legislation that would allow residents to carry a handgun after going through a background check, taking a firearms training course, passing a test, and paying a $500 fee. In 2013, Van Drew voted as the only Democrat against a series of 10&nbsp;gun control bills following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Van Drew also voiced support for expanded background checks and the regulation for silencers. Despite his pro-gun stance, the gun-control group Moms Demand Action designated Van Drew a “Gun Sense Candidate”.</p><p>On November 6, 2007, Van Drew won his bid for a seat in the New Jersey Senate, defeating Republican incumbent Nicholas Asselta. In November 2011, Van Drew defeated Republican challenger David S. DeWeese by a margin of 24,557-20,857.
