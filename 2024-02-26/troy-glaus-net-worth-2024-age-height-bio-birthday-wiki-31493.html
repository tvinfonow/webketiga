As an established veteran, he was in demand on the free agent market and able to field lucrative offers for long term contracts. Although Glaus had spent his entire career an Angel, and was a fan favorite, the team decided not to pursue Glaus’ return. Amid concerns about Glaus’ future health after his injury, the team decided to go with the much lower-priced alternative of turning the third base position over to young prospect Dallas McPherson, whom they felt had a good chance to soon become as productive as Glaus had been.</p><h2>Who is Troy Glaus Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Troy Glaus</strong> married to <strong>Ann Glaus </strong>.

He also led the league in adjusted range factor (2.92), but his 24 errors tied him with David Wright for the most errors by a third baseman in the Major Leagues, and he had a Major League-low .946 fielding percentage at third. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the off-season along with minor league shortstop Sergio Santos. The trade sent pitcher Miguel Batista and second baseman Orlando Hudson to the Diamondbacks. The Jays badly needed a power bat a year after letting go of Carlos Delgado, however the emergence of Hudson at second base gave the statistical advantage of this trade to the Diamondbacks.</p><h3>Where is Troy Glaus today?</h3><p>Glaus resides in <b>Ocala, Florida</b>, with his wife, Ann.</p><h3>Is Troy Glaus a Hall of Famer?</h3><p>1) Would Troy Glaus be a Hall of Famer if his career ended today?
