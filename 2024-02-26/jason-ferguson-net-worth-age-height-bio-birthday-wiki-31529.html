That following off-season he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a sixth round draft pick in the 2009 NFL Draft (#197-Stephen Hodge). The teams also swapped their 2008 sixth-rounders (#167-Erik Walden), with the Cowboys moving up from the bottom third to the top of that round.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jason Ferguson height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Huang <strong>weight</strong> <strong>311&nbsp; lbs</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>311&nbsp; lbs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Falling to the seventh round of the 1997 NFL Draft, Ferguson was selected 229th overall by Bill Parcells’ New York Jets. The Jets were the only club to invite him for a visit before the draft, because most teams apparently dissuaded from considering him after he was tested positive for marijuana at the pre-draft combine, reportedly being the only player to do so. Seventeen defensive tackles were taken ahead of him, including Darrell Russell and Renaldo Wynn in the first round. Parcells originally expressed reluctance to pick Ferguson at all, but trusted Georgia’s head coach, Jim Donnan. Ferguson was signed to a two-year deal by the Jets only few days after the draft.</p><p align=justify>In a game against the Carolina Panthers on November 19, Ferguson suffered right knee injury that caused him to miss the rest of the 2009 NFL season. Considering his age and the fact that he is playing on the last year of his contract, it was believed that this injury would end his 13-year tenure as an NFL player because he planned to either re-sign with the Dolphins, or retire.</p><h2>Who is Jason Ferguson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jason Ferguson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
