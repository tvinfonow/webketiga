An ex-poker entrepreneur was arrested for running an illegal high-stakes poker tournament that began at The Viper Room in Los Angeles. It featured a lot of celebrities and A-listers.&nbsp;Molly’s Game (2014), her memoir that she shared with the world, was made into a feature film.</p><p>In Molly’s Game, she was played by&nbsp;She was portrayed by <a href=#>Jessica Chastain</a> in the film adaptation in Molly’s Game..</p><p>Molly Bloom (born April 21, 1978) is an American entrepreneur, speaker, and author of the 2014 memoir Molly’s Game: The True Story of the 26-Year-Old Woman Behind the Most Exclusive, High-Stakes Underground Poker Game in the World. She had trained for years to become an Olympic skier, but was injured while trying to qualify for the Olympics.</p><p>In 2004, Bloom moved to Los Angeles and found work as a barmaid. In 2004, Darin Feinstein, one of the co-owners of The Viper Room, was approached by actor Tobey Maguire about hosting a high-stakes poker game in the basement of the club. Feinstein recruited Bloom to cater to the players and manage the game. In 2007, Bloom started her own business, registering Molly Bloom Inc. as an event and catering company to host poker tournaments. By 2008, the games had graduated to private homes and hotels like the Peninsula Beverly Hills, with hands going as high as $4 million. In addition to Maguire, many wealthy individuals, celebrities and sports figures were known to frequent the games including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Gores, Macaulay Culkin, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez, Nelly, Mary Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen, Phil Ivey, Rick Salomon and Andy Beal. The onset of the 2008 recession made underground poker games less common, and in 2009, Bloom moved to an Upper West Side high-rise near Manhattan’s Lincoln Center. She began organizing games in a private apartment at the new Astor Place and suites at the Plaza Hotel, which used the same sophisticated dealing equipment used in casinos, and which were staffed by women hired from 1 Oak, an exclusive nightclub. However, Bloom had fewer contacts in New York, where raids on underground games prompted them to relocate to Long Island. As a result of this, Bloom attracted rich businessmen from Wall Street but also more disreputable gamblers whose bids were significantly smaller than those in Los Angeles. In June 2010, Bloom was served with a $116,133 tax lien for failing to pay appropriate taxes on her New York events.</p><p align=justify>Her brother,&nbsp;Her brother is former Olympic skier and NFL player <a href=#>Jeremy Bloom</a>.
