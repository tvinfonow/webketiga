Who is Slug dating now & how much money does Slug have?</p><h2>Slug Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Slug</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>September 7, 1972</strong> in Minneapolis, Minnesota, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Sean Michael Daley (born September 7, 1972), better known by his stage name Slug, is an American rapper from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Slug is best known as one half of the hip hop group Atmosphere, which he founded with Derek Turner (Spawn). Turner has since left and Anthony Davis (Ant) produces Atmosphere with Slug. In 1995, Slug, in collaboration with Anthony Davis, Musab Saad, and Brent Sayers founded the Minneapolis-based independent hip hop record label Rhymesayers Entertainment.</p><p>A character Slug refers to as “Lucy”, who has been purported to symbolize a range of different entities, is the most notable of these allegories. In earlier Atmosphere songs, it is believed that Slug used Lucy as a means of writing about ex-girlfriends. Lucy became so prominent that Atmosphere’s 2001 album bore her name, Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs, with the record itself concentrating fairly heavily on women and relationships, in songs such as “Don’t Ever Fucking Question That” and “Mama Had A Baby And His Head Popped Off”. Slug himself has since said of Lucy that he originally believed “her” to be a representation of the dichotomy between himself and women. He acknowledges now that Lucy became a demonization (“Lucy Ford” being a play on words for Lucifer) of himself and his dependency on alcohol, drugs, sex and validation.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Slug</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stanimir</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marinov</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minneapolis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minnesota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Craig Daley, Valerie Daley</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jessica Daley</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jacob Daley</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Slug ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Slug's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Slug's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 2005, Slug and MURS started up Women Records, a record label through which they would release the albums of rock bands that they were friends with. The label was set up as an imprint through Rhymesayers Entertainment.</p><h2>Slug Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Slug is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Slug</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Slug was born Sean Michael Daley in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on September 7, 1972. The son of Valerie and Craig Daley, he is of Irish, Norwegian, African-American, and Native American descent. Slug’s nickname comes from his father’s; his dad was known to his friends as “Sluggo” and thus they began to call Sean “little Sluggo,” which he shortened to “Slug”. In Atmosphere’s early years, Slug DJ’d behind the scenes and let Spawn handle lyrics. The group eventually formed a strong relationship with Ant (Anthony Davis) and began collaborating on music. Along with solo MC Musab (then Beyond), and groups Black hole, Phull Surkle, and the Abstract Pack they formed the mid-1990s crew Headshots, with Slug appearing on the underground tape series HeadShots (1-7).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Slug raps in an introspective style, as seen on the song “Little Man”, in which he confronts the complaints that people have about him by looking at his relationship with his father and son. This introspective style has become less prevalent as of Atmosphere’s 2008 album When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold in which Slug navigates through other people’s lives. Slug has stated that in and around the year of 2005, he began to move in a new direction lyrically as he became more aware of the effect his lyrics would have on kids, especially his own son who was becoming a teenager at the time.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Slug height</b> Not available right now.

Daley has stated: “[…] when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, there was a lot of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a particular woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at. Furthermore, Slug has criticised Atmosphere’s debut album Overcast! saying: “It’s obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it’s not a person it’s more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper.”</p><h2>Who is Slug Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Slug</strong> married to <strong>Jessica Daley</strong>.
