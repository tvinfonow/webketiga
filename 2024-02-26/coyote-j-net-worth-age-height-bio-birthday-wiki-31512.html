When WERC night time jock Chris Foxx (aka ‘Superfoxx’) abruptly quit over a contract dispute in late 1974, the company flipped Battan to WERC’s AM from the FM and christened him Coyote J Calhoun (this time the name would stick). From 1975 to 1979 Coyote J was enormously popular in Birmingham and consistently won the 12 + audience during his reign. In one of his most controversial acts, Coyote J faked his own murder on-air, a stunt that led police and paramedics to storm the building expecting to find a knife wielding intruder inside. This led to a 5-day suspension, the first of many that would be handed down to the disc-jockey. Calhoun wrestled a live black bear before a packed house at Boutwell Auditorium in 1976. The fight abruptly ended after Coyote hit the bear over the head with a folding chair, annoying its handlers. When asked why he did it, Coyote replied, ‘he started it.’ In 1979, near the end of WERC’s dominance and with the demise of AM Top 40 radio in sight, Coyote J resigned and left for Los Angeles to do stand up comedy and immerse himself in the neophyte punk/new wave scene.</p><h2>Coyote J Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Coyote J is one of the <strong>richest Radio Disc Jockey</strong> from United States.
